Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture- Analysis of the Impact Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique;Furthermore, due to the precariousness of the materials used during manufacturing, these fishing vessels are destroyed when there are strong climatic events such as cyclones and storms allied to the drainage area that is not safe and without protection.;CCFIMZ_143;;;;;1;FISH;;;;;;;
Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture- Analysis of the Impact Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique;The lack of timely communication of the occurrences of climatic events also leads to poor awareness and consequently negatively impacts fishing communities.;CCFIMZ_144;;;;;1;FISH;;;;;;;
Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture- Analysis of the Impact Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique;According to Ramenzoni et al. (2020), the impacts of climatic events in the fisheries sector are varied, including changes in ecological conditions, acceleration of coastal zone degradation through soil entrainment, vegetation degradation.;CCFIMZ_148;;;;;1;FISH;;;;;;;
Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture- Analysis of the Impact Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique;Our results agree with those reported by McConney et al. (2009), who identified the effects of climate change on small-scale fisheries in the eastern Caribbean where they indicated a negative biological response from fish when ocean temperatures changed due to climate change.;CCFIMZ_150;;;;;1;FISH;;;;;;;
Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture- Analysis of the Impact Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique;The lack of education and other income-generating activities exacerbates the fishermen's dependence on fishing activities thereby creating additional pressure on the sector and declining fisheries.;CCFIMZ_157;;;;;1;FISH;;;;;;;
Climate Change in Fisheries and Aquaculture- Analysis of the Impact Caused by Idai and Kenneth Cyclones in Mozambique;Our study has revealed that the cyclones Idai and Kenneth affected part of aquaculture and fisheries production, leaving various infrastructures and equipment destroyed.;CCFIMZ_164;;;;;1;FISH;;;;;;;
