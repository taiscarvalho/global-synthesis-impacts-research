### Global synthesis of peer-reviewed articles reveals blind spots in climate impacts research

This repository contains the code supporting the paper "Global synthesis of peer-reviewed articles reveals blind spots in climate impacts research." It includes scripts for text preprocessing, annotation processing, and information extraction from scientific papers:

* tokenize_papers.ipynb – Tokenizes full-text papers into sentences and preprocesses text.
* read_annotated_papers.ipynb – Reads annotated papers from the annotation software Inception.
* extract_hazard_information_abstract.ipynb – Uses LLMs to extract hazard-related information from abstracts.

The repository enables systematic analysis of climate impact research coverage and gaps.
