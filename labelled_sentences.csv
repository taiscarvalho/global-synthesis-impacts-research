PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;1. Introduction;IMAEAS_1;PaperSection
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Rising global surface temperatures have given way to an increased intensity of natural disasters, including hurricanes, which could have detrimental effects on health and well-being.1;PHIMPR_1;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;The Atlantic Ocean had its most active hurricane season on record in 2020, with 30 named tropical storms,2 ten of which underwent rapid intensification.3 Exposure to hurricanes and other disasters is a consistent predictor of individual adverse health outcomes, including worsening of chronic disease, infections,4–6 and mental health disorders.7–9;PHIMPR_2;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Reducing exposure to hurricane-related stressors at individual and community levels could potentially prevent associated adverse health outcomes.9;PHIMPR_3;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;The track and intensity of hurricanes are reasonably estimated a day or more prior to their impact on land.;PHIMPR_4;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;This provides time for government and other entities to issue warnings and calls for actions, including evacuation and preparation for potential damage to homes, and disruption of power and water and food access.;PHIMPR_5;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;For example, residents of hurricane-prone areas, such as those in low lying areas, are often advised to prepare “disaster kits” and “grab bags” and identify areas within the home to avoid injury.10, 11;PHIMPR_6;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Importantly, hurricanes generally occur within the defined hurricane season, allowing people in hurricane prone areas to prepare well in advance to avoid adverse health outcomes.;PHIMPR_7;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Prior research indicates low levels of disaster preparedness, even in disaster-prone areas.;PHIMPR_8;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;For example, data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) showed that 78% of participants in United States (US) reported feeling prepared for a disaster in 2006, but only 45% were actually adequately prepared.12;PHIMPR_9;PriorWork
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;A 2012 review suggested that only 30–40% of US residents had emergency supplies.13;PHIMPR_10;PriorWork
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Even in an area where people have previously experienced hurricane disasters, only 8% of participants had enough food, water, and medications to last three days or more.14;PHIMPR_11;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Several studies identified barriers preventing people from preparing adequately, including lack of time and resources for emergency supplies, as well as unclear messages on how to prepare.12–15;PHIMPR_12;PriorWork
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;The majority of studies to date have helped identify gaps in preparedness in different populations, including high-risk groups like older adults11, 15–17 and residents of disaster prone areas.18, 19;PHIMPR_13;PriorWork
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;However, many of these studies asked participants about their preparedness for a hypothetical future disaster.;PHIMPR_14;PriorWork
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Hence, these studies do not assess how actual preparedness efforts influenced disaster impacts.;PHIMPR_15;Motivation
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Also, most studies did not evaluate individual components of preparedness (e.g. water, food), and only a few drew on qualitative or mixed methods data to understand gaps in disaster preparedness.;PHIMPR_16;Motivation
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Puerto Rico (PR), a US territory since 1898, is an archipelago in a very hurricane-prone region in the Caribbean.;PHIMPR_17;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Adults living in PR have a higher incidence of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity compared to adults living in mainland US.;PHIMPR_18;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Hurricane Irma passed close to Puerto Rico (PR) on September 6, 2017 with Category 5 winds, resulting in significant flooding, widespread power outages, and water supply disruptions.20, 21;PHIMPR_19;Impact

PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;One recent study in the US Virgin Islands29 found that older adults and people with chronic disease faced the most adverse health impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.;PHIMPR_24;Impact
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Limited access to water along with prolonged loss of power due to Hurricane Maria were suggested to have been major contributors to high morbidity and excess mortality in Puerto Rico.23, 24;PHIMPR_25;Impact
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;However, preparedness and its association with health impacts has not been evaluated in this context.;PHIMPR_26;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Several studies show that patients with diabetes have serious complications in unfavorable environments due to disrupted health services and limited resources30.;PHIMPR_27;PriorWork
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Potential explanations include anxiety, overeating, interruption of medications and physical activity, disruption of water supply, and limited resources after natural disasters31–33.;PHIMPR_28;Background
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;The publications estimating death tolls after Hurricane Maria23, 24 did not evaluate NCD, which may explain the increased mortality.;PHIMPR_29;PriorWork

PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Although power loss may have likely impacted health directly (e.g., for people who needed powered medical devices) or indirectly, everyone lost power so there was no comparison group without power loss.;PHIMPR_163;Discussion
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;However, our results do suggest an indirect impact of power loss as it affected many people’s diet due to lack of access to refrigeration and cooking means, and the diet changes were detrimentally associated with health.;PHIMPR_164;Impact
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Although food stored in preparation for the hurricane lasted an average of 5.2 weeks, and 45% of participants stored food to last a month or longer, 78% of participants reported making diet changes for one month or more due to lack of means to refrigerate or cook.;PHIMPR_165;Impact
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Over one-fourth of the participants made longer-term diet changes due to food accessibility or financial impact.;PHIMPR_166;Impact
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;The associations between duration the stored food lasted, and diet changes were not significant, suggesting that other aspects, such as alternative cooking means and receiving help from government or other sources, may have mitigated the impact.;PHIMPR_167;Discussion
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Detrimental dietary changes (resulting from poor food preparedness and access) could exacerbate chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes37.;PHIMPR_168;Discussion
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Given the gaps in information reported regarding food security and storage options, more guidance is needed (e.g., on nutritious food that does not need refrigeration, proper storage methods for different food items, and managing food in the fridge after power loss).;PHIMPR_169;Recommendation
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;Considering that Puerto Rico relies considerably on importing food, post-disaster food accessibility may also be highly contingent on importing adequate food supplies and having the means to preserve perishable items and cook.;PHIMPR_170;Discussion
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;People also need access and resources prior to hurricanes, so that affordable and nutritious shelf-stable food can be stored to last for several weeks or even months after power loss to reduce food insecurity after disasters.;PHIMPR_171;Recommendation
PHIMPR;Preparedness, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and Impact on Health in Puerto Rico;The findings suggest that COSSMA participants, who had lower levels of socioeconomic status, were older and more likely to live in rural locations, experienced longer periods of power loss, and were more likely to experience economic impacts of the hurricanes, relative to their counterparts in SOALS.;PHIMPR_172;Results

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;In the past, data collection techniques were less effective and provided limited information for use in contextual judgment and decision making.;HDPRFK_8;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Consequently, owing to the lack of information available for contextual judgment and decision making, disaster responses were highly dependent on the subjective experiences of decision makers.;HDPRFK_9;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Furthermore, although data collection technology has developed rapidly with an increase in the information available for decision making, the capability of humans to process and use this information in disaster response is limited, especially in cases that require swift decision making.;HDPRFK_10;Background

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;These extreme weather conditions occur locally and extensively, which limits rapid disaster response.;HDPRFK_18;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;In particular, because such extreme weather conditions occur extensively throughout a region, response procedures, such as preparing resources immediately in the event of a disaster, are limited.;HDPRFK_19;Background

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Test Area South Korea was selected as the test bed, and its heatwave characteristics were investigated to establish the range and duration of the collected data for model training.;HDPRFK_32;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The typical weather pattern that causes heatwaves in South Korea is a significant rise in temperature during the daytime, owing to stagnant high atmospheric pressure, which is a widespread occurrence across the country [13].;HDPRFK_33;HazardCause
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Although heatwave standards vary by country, a heatwave warning in South Korea is issued when the daily maximum temperature is expected to be above 33 °C for at least 2 consecutive days.;HDPRFK_34;HazardDescription

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Variable Selection Relevant variables were selected to predict heat-related damage.;HDPRFK_41;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;"Heat-related diseases mainly occur in the form of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and heatstroke [17]; consequently, various epidemiological studies of their occurrence have been conducted worldwide [17,18,19].";HDPRFK_42;PriorWork
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Among the most important characteristics of the damage caused by heatwaves and the corresponding vulnerabilities are the damage patterns of disasters, which cannot be obtained from temperature variables alone [20,21].;HDPRFK_43;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Studies have shown that the damage caused by disasters is related to geographic features [22,23], surface relative humidity [24,25,26], wind speed [27,28], population density [29], economic status [30], and vulnerable occupational groups (laborers, construction, and agricultural workers)  [31,32,33,34].;HDPRFK_44;PriorWork
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;On the basis of important characteristics determined in previous studies, we selected the following variables: temperature, humidity, wind speed, number of vulnerable occupational groups, insurance premiums per person, personal income per person, floating population, and registered population of residents (the number of people counted by the administration).;HDPRFK_45;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;"The vulnerable population can be inferred from data on insurance premiums, income, and vulnerable occupational groups; further, as the values of these indicators increased, the number of patients with thermal diseases increased.";HDPRFK_46;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;However, both the aggregate and floating populations were used as population variables, and it was expected that the floating population, which reflects real-time information, would be a more useful variable for predictions than the aggregate population.;HDPRFK_47;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Random Forest Regression RF is an ensemble machine learning method that combines several separately trained models to create a strong learner that can be applied for classification and regression [35].;HDPRFK_48;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Such a combination of individual models can reduce overfitting and improve generalization.;HDPRFK_49;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Therefore, RF has the advantages of high prediction accuracy and algorithm robustness.;HDPRFK_50;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;When training ensemble classifiers, techniques involving the use of different datasets or properties are applied to create different training models.;HDPRFK_51;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;As shown in Figure 1, RF is based on the bootstrap method which is resampling technique that involves random sampling of a dataset with replacement.;HDPRFK_52;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Then repeats the process k times to obtain several independent and identically distributed training subsets;HDPRFK_53;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Then, m features from the n samples are selected without accepting duplicate samples.;HDPRFK_54;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Prediction results from different decision trees build each training subset.;HDPRFK_55;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The most commonly obtained forecast results are selected and determined by the final forecast [35,36].;HDPRFK_56;Method

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;A loss function measures the similarity between the values predicted by a model and the correct values.;HDPRFK_59;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;To increase the accuracy of a model, the loss should be reduced as the model is trained.;HDPRFK_60;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Different loss functions are used depending on the characteristics of the model (classification or regression) and dataset.;HDPRFK_61;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The representative loss functions for measuring errors in regression models are mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE):;HDPRFK_62;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;When determining the MAE, the difference between the observed and predicted values of each data point is summed, and when determining the MSE, the square of the difference between observed and predicted values is summed.;HDPRFK_63;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Therefore, the MSE is more sensitive to outlier values than the MAE.;HDPRFK_64;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;When the temperature exceeds a certain range, the heatstroke patients with thermal damage is characterized by a rapid increase in the incidence of patients.;HDPRFK_65;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Consequently, MAE was considered as a loss function in this study to apply the characteristic of the target data.;HDPRFK_66;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;To evaluate regression models, the proximity of predicted values to the observed data is quantified on the basis of the MAE, root mean squared error (RMSE), root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE), and coefficient of determination (R2), which are mainly used to evaluate accuracy [41,42].;HDPRFK_67;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;"However, the mean deviations of MAE, RMSE, and RMSLE (the lower the value, the higher the accuracy) have different values depending on the scale; therefore, it is difficult to make inferences using the absolute values alone.";HDPRFK_68;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;"In contrast, R2 is a relative value because it is the variance ratio of dependent variables predicted from independent variables; thus, the performance can be intuitively determined.";HDPRFK_69;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;R2 generally ranges from 0 to 1.;HDPRFK_70;Method

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The lowest MAE was found for the training, OOB, and test errors as n-tree and max depth increased, and is shown in Figure 3.;HDPRFK_104;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;When the number of decision trees was more than 100, all graphs remained almost unchanged, and when the number of decision trees was 181, the lowest OOB error was found (4.59).;HDPRFK_105;Results

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Feature Importance Figure 5 shows the estimated variable importance rankings corresponding to the model.;HDPRFK_125;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The weekly mean temperature variable, which had a value of 0.440, contributed the most in this model, followed by the vulnerable occupational groups (0.129), weekly median temperature (0.102), floating population (0.098), and weekly max temperature (0.085) variables.;HDPRFK_126;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;These five variables can be considered the main variables for prediction, whereas the rest are less important.;HDPRFK_127;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Interestingly, the variable importance rankings proved that the floating population variable, which changes with time, had a greater effect on prediction than the population of registered residents.;HDPRFK_128;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;However, regional economic indicators had less impact on diseases related to heatwaves, as observed from the low values for income (0.020) and insurance (0.013).;HDPRFK_129;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Model Application and Visualization To apply the validated model, we predetermined the dynamic variables from predictions.;HDPRFK_130;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Because the time series of variables and result values were the same, the predicted variable values must be used for prediction.;HDPRFK_131;Method

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The forecasted and observed values for Seoul were compared for 4 weeks, and in the second week of June, the predicted values for each administrative district of South Korea were numerically quantified to visualize the high-risk areas and provide information to heatwave disaster response decision makers.;HDPRFK_136;Method

HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;However, existing predictions are limited to practical notification systems owing to unrepresentative data and insufficient data accuracy [51].;HDPRFK_141;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;However, existing predictions are limited to practical notification systems owing to unrepresentative data and insufficient data accuracy [51].;HDPRFK_141;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;According to previous research, this problem is due to the use of heatwave mortality alone as the endpoint of damage.;HDPRFK_142;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Because the mortality rate of heatwaves is exceedingly small compared to that of the general population, it is more effective to predict risk by morbidity, which is relatively higher in proportion than heatwave mortality.;HDPRFK_143;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;“Temperatures exceeding 33 °C” is the only available criterion for identifying the danger of heatwaves in South Korea, which allows the government to raise risk awareness by alerting the public.;HDPRFK_144;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;However, the damage to the population (deaths and sickness) caused by heatwaves varies even at the same temperature.;HDPRFK_145;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Therefore, using only temperature data cannot determine the level of damage to peoples’ health.;HDPRFK_146;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;On the basis of epidemiological investigations performed in previous research, we selected relevant variables and evaluated them by the Boruta algorithm. Then, a random forest-based heatwave damage prediction method was proposed, and its performance was compared with other traditional models.;HDPRFK_147;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Previous studies considering demographic information have mainly used data with static characteristics, such as monthly statistical information.;HDPRFK_148;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;More accurate predictions were achieved by matching the exposure to heatwaves in a specific area to the population in that area using dynamic population data updated more frequently, allowing this variable to contribute more to the prediction.;HDPRFK_149;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;In the evaluation of the importance of variables, the average temperature variable and the number of occupational groups that are considered to be vulnerable to heat waves were highly evaluated (the average temperature for a week is the sum of the week, that is, the accumulated temperature).;HDPRFK_150;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;This result supports the importance of predicting the cumulative temperature in advance and responding in advance in order to minimize heat damage.;HDPRFK_151;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;In addition, it provides grounds that preemptive responses from the government, such as operation of sprinkler trucks and installation of shade curtains, should be made in areas with many vulnerable occupations.;HDPRFK_152;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The learning process performed to build the machine learning model used independent variables based on previously recorded data.;HDPRFK_153;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;However, it is difficult to apply big data to a real-time environment owing to limitations such as irregularity in the frequency of data.;HDPRFK_154;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Furthermore, when the time series of the dependent and independent variables are configured identically in training, the conditions for predictions are not effectively established in practical systems.;HDPRFK_155;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Therefore, a method that employs predicted variable values was proposed.;HDPRFK_156;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Although the accuracy of predicting future patients by applying predicted data is lower than the test accuracy during validation, the R2 value of 0.70 supports the fact that this model provides reasonable information.;HDPRFK_157;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Governments can use the methods developed in this study to provide disaster response decision makers with a reasonable basis for prioritizing an administrative area to provide a preemptive response and disaster support.;HDPRFK_158;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Nonetheless, this study has several limitations.;HDPRFK_159;Conclusion
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;"First, the temporal resolution of the predicted values is relatively coarse-grained; thus, it is impossible to provide daily predictions for heatwaves, which are expected to occur every day.";HDPRFK_160;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Most studies on heatwaves in South Korea have provided weekly information [11,49].;HDPRFK_161;PriorWork
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;As a result, it was inferred that the resolution of target values (heat patients) is tailored to the minimum information time unit of data source.;HDPRFK_162;Results
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Secondly, during the experiment, data obtained across the country were input into one learning algorithm, and regional differences between administrative districts were not considered.;HDPRFK_163;Method
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;"South Korea is a relatively small country; although the regional environmental difference is relatively smaller than that in larger countries, the differences in geography and weather between its eastern and western regions are substantial.";HDPRFK_164;Background
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Therefore, developing individual algorithms for each region can improve model performance.;HDPRFK_165;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;This problem can be solved because the model can be trained for each region if sufficient datasets are available.;HDPRFK_166;Recommendation
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;Since 2018, South Korea has been managing vulnerable populations by operating heatwave shelters.;HDPRFK_167;Response
HDPRFK;Heatwave Damage Prediction Using Random Forest Model in Korea;The prediction model established in this study will contribute to future studies to select regions at risk of heatwaves and provide decision makers with a basis for installing heat shelters using high regional resolutions and estimating the cumulative number of patients relative to the population.;HDPRFK_168;Conclusion

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Most relevant Telegram research involves either the production of Telegram bots for distributing hazard information on the platform [41,42], or contains limited investigation and validation of hazard impacts and spatio-temporal trends from the event [43–45].;SSFIKI_40;PriorWork
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, all previous Telegram social sensing studies were carried out on Telegram Channels, where an admin broadcasts messages to channel followers (one-to-many communication).;SSFIKI_41;PriorWork
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Channels are appropriate for news distribution, however, are not conducive to promoting organic conversation for social sensing.;SSFIKI_42;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This work investigates Telegram chats called supergroups.;SSFIKI_43;Data
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;These allow for many-to-many conversations, providing a much richer form of social impact data.;SSFIKI_44;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The Kerala Rescue application was set up initially by student volunteers as a mechanism to coordinate requests and offers of help during the 2018 flood event, quickly becoming a widely used service supported by Kerala's state government.;SSFIKI_45;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This citizen science initiative differs from social sensing using social media, in that the information it utilises is structured into a database format designed for the purpose, whereas social media content is unsolicited and unstructured.;SSFIKI_46;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The processing requirements for these platforms therefore differ.;SSFIKI_47;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The Rebuild Kerala database was put together by the Government of Kerala after the 2018 event to manage the distribution of financial aid related to property damage [46].;SSFIKI_48;Response
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Reports were collected by citizen surveys, validated by local officials, and then either approved/rejected for aid by the state government.;SSFIKI_49;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;More details on these data sources and how the data from each was processed is given below.;SSFIKI_50;Metadata
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The experiment performed in this study is a triangulation between the different data sources.;SSFIKI_51;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While accurate “ground truth” information may be constructed for the extent of floodwaters [20], it is very difficult to collate accurate ground truth information for the social impacts of flooding.;SSFIKI_52;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;A disastrous flood event such as Kerala 2018 affected many people in many ways, with each individual having their own story.;SSFIKI_53;Impact
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;As such, the true social and economic impacts of the flood may never be known completely.;SSFIKI_54;CascadingImpact
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Sources of economic information such as the financial losses and compensation, property damage, damage to agricultural land, and disruption to economic activities and livelihoods, are diverse and difficult to unify into a single metric.;SSFIKI_55;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;"Measurement of social impacts beyond the tragic loss of life is also hard to perform; the level of distress, loss of health and wellbeing, and impacts on families and communities are almost impossible to quantify.";SSFIKI_56;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Therefore our study does not seek to use the social sensing approach to accurately recover some known ground truth observation.;SSFIKI_57;Objective
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Instead, it compares and contrasts the view of the flood impacts that are offered by several different sources: two social media platforms, a citizen relief app, and a governmental database.;SSFIKI_58;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The rigorous analysis of Telegram in this study is novel, providing clear evidence that the platform can and should be used for social sensing.;SSFIKI_59;Objective
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Additionally, social sensing studies are rarely validated to this depth.;SSFIKI_60;Motivation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This systematic comparison of four very different data sources is a unique approach for investigating and validating flood impacts and social sensing itself.;SSFIKI_61;Objective
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Each of the sources might be expected to reveal a part of the overall situation during the flood event.;SSFIKI_62;Objective
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Their agreement in when and where flood impacts are observed, and the nature of the information they contain, will help to evaluate the potential for such data to be used in future flood events to support decision-making and planning.;SSFIKI_63;Objective

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Here we explore the potential for detecting the impacts of the Kerala floods using publicly accessible data from Telegram and Twitter.;SSFIKI_68;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Data from both platforms is collected and filtered for relevance, then used to create time series plots and spatial maps of flood-related activity.;SSFIKI_69;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;These are compared to similar figures based on public submissions to the Kerala Rescue app, a citizen-generated web service set up during the flood event to allow affected people to submit requests for help [47].;SSFIKI_70;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;A further comparison is made to damage data collected after the event by the government-sponsored Rebuild Kerala initiative [46].;SSFIKI_71;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While it is known that WhatsApp was widely used during the event to coordinate rescue and relief efforts [48], we are not able to study WhatsApp data due to privacy restrictions on the platform. As well as considering the ability of Telegram and Twitter data to accurately map the social impacts of the flood event, we also examine content from each platform as a source of data about what kinds of impact were experienced.;SSFIKI_72;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;2.1 Telegram Telegram is a social media messaging platform which, like many other messaging services, allows for end-to-end encrypted conversations and groups.;SSFIKI_73;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The feature that differentiates Telegram from its competition is public group chats called supergroups.;SSFIKI_74;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;With up to 200,000 members [40], supergroups promote conversation within local communities [49].;SSFIKI_75;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For this work, conversations from the supergroup ‘KeralaGram’ were downloaded using the inbuilt ‘Export Chat’ function in the Telegram desktop application.;SSFIKI_76;Data
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Messages were received in JSON format, and shared media was received in its original format (i.e. MP3 for audio and JPEG for images).;SSFIKI_77;Data
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;With around 15,000 members, ‘KeralaGram’ is the largest public community discussion group in Kerala.;SSFIKI_78;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The data used within this study is publicly accessible, with all processing and analysis following the Telegram terms of service.;SSFIKI_79;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;During the flood period, a rise in the amount of posts sharing other media was detected, with a 450% increase in shared images compared to the same date range within the previous month.;SSFIKI_80;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;These images consisted largely of flood photos, alongside screenshots of warnings and messages from other platforms.;SSFIKI_81;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To utilise this media increase, basic computer vision was applied, automatically adjusting the image color and contrast to optimise the extraction of English and Malayalam text using the OCR library Tesseract [50].;SSFIKI_82;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Next, the language detection Python library “langdetect” was applied to the messages [51].;SSFIKI_83;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While this package occasionally misclassifies text, its purpose here is to provide a rough overview of the languages present.;SSFIKI_84;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;With only 28% of the dataset being detected as English, machine translation was needed.;SSFIKI_85;Method

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Bots are often found in social media data, however, due to the presence of admins and strict rules within this chat, the conversation post-translation was highly regulated and did not require bot filtering.;SSFIKI_88;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Additionally, after location inference (see section 2.5), relevance filtering was not required as the flood caused a large shift in messaging content and structure, with a 98% relevance of located messages (see Fig. 1).;SSFIKI_89;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;A post was only considered relevant if it was directly discussing the 2018 Kerala flood, for instance requesting help or sharing information about the event.;SSFIKI_90;Method

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The final dataset contained 13,614 messages and 1188 images containing text between 1st August - 23rd August.;SSFIKI_93;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;2.2 Twitter Twitter is a social media microblogging platform, where users produce character restricted messages called tweets.;SSFIKI_94;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Tweets are stored in JSON format and can be collected for free in real-time or purchased retrospectively from Twitter's Historical PowerTrack service.;SSFIKI_95;Data
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For this work, the PowerTrack service was used to obtain all tweets identified by Twitter as originating from India (that is, having an ‘IN’ country code in their location metadata) between 1st August to 23rd August.;SSFIKI_96;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This collection contained 1,363,659 tweets.;SSFIKI_97;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;All tweets in this collection contain either exact tweet coordinates from GPS enabled devices or a user-defined tweet ‘place’ attribute, which is used by Twitter to designate their country code.;SSFIKI_98;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The following analysis and investigation is consistent with the Twitter terms of service.;SSFIKI_99;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The first filtering step was extracting English language tweets.;SSFIKI_100;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While machine translation of tweets in other local languages is possible, it is slow to perform and therefore infeasible for the high volume of tweets in the dataset.;SSFIKI_101;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;"Despite this, the language attribute within the tweet JSON objects highlighted that English was the most common language in our dataset, with 90% of tweets in English; therefore, simply extracting the English tagged tweets was deemed sufficient.";SSFIKI_102;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Location inference (see section 2.5) was used to locate and identify tweets that both concerned and originated from Kerala.;SSFIKI_103;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This decreased the dataset to 24,414 tweets.;SSFIKI_104;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Inspection of tweet volumes suggested that bot removal was not required as no account had tweeted excessively (following the >1% rule successfully implemented by Arthur et al. [28]. The tweet collection was geographic, rather than thematic, so to extract relevant tweets a list of keywords was produced, containing both common English-language flood terms and words frequently used in Kerala Rescue requests (Appendix A.1).;SSFIKI_105;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;If the tweet text did not overlap with this list (i.e. contained no words in the keyword list), the tweet was ignored.;SSFIKI_106;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This resulted in 7097 tweets related to floods.;SSFIKI_107;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Next, a manual inspection of the remaining tweets highlighted numerous duplicates, with only minor differences such as the tagged user or a hashtag.;SSFIKI_108;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The majority of these posts originated from automated and institutional Twitter accounts and did not include useful on-the-ground observations of flood impacts.;SSFIKI_109;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To remove these, tweet texts were vectorised by word frequency using the scikit-learn package [52] in Python and the cosine similarity between them was calculated.;SSFIKI_110;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To decrease computation times, stop words and punctuation were removed from tweets before vectorisation.;SSFIKI_111;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;If any two vectors had a 97% or above cosine similarity between them, then they were deemed as duplicates, and only the tweet posted first was kept.;SSFIKI_112;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This successfully removed obvious duplicates.;SSFIKI_113;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;However, large groups of messages that differed by only a few words remained.;SSFIKI_114;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To remove these, if at least 10 vectors showed a cosine similarity above 90%, the corresponding messages were classified as duplicates and once again only the original tweet was kept in the dataset.;SSFIKI_115;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While the 97% and 90% thresholds were heuristically chosen, manual inspection showed they were appropriate for removing unwanted messages.;SSFIKI_116;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Removal of duplicates left 6936 tweets for further analysis.;SSFIKI_117;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Manual inspection (using the same criteria as section 2.1) of a randomly selected 20% sample of the remaining tweets showed a 96% relevance indicating that further relevance filtering was not required.;SSFIKI_118;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;A sample filtered tweet is shown in Table 1.;SSFIKI_119;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;2.3 Kerala Rescue Kerala Rescue is an emergency request platform, allowing those impacted by the flood to submit a request for services including rescue, food, water, clothing, and medicine.;SSFIKI_120;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;It was created by a college student from Kerala during the early stages of the flood [47].;SSFIKI_121;PriorWork
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;After 10 days, an additional 200 software developers were actively developing the site, with 50,000 registered Kerala volunteers responding to and validating the 45,000 requests [47].;SSFIKI_122;PriorWork
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The data was collected with permission from the developers in JSON format from a public Slack channel active during the floods.;SSFIKI_123;Data
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Since the data is potentially sensitive, data was anonymised prior to analysis and no identifiable results are displayed.;SSFIKI_124;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The Kerala Rescue database contains help requests formatted as records that each contain 27 columns including location fields, rescue details, and requester contact number.;SSFIKI_125;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The first processing step was the removal of duplicate entries.;SSFIKI_126;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Due to the ambiguity between duplicate requests and follow up requests, if two entries with the same contact number were posted within an hour of each other, and if either their location or requester attributes were duplicated, then only the original entry was kept.;SSFIKI_127;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This removed over 5000 entries, which upon manual inspection were correctly classified as duplicates.;SSFIKI_128;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Location information was provided as both coordinate fields and as entries in a text field.;SSFIKI_129;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To remove inaccurate location coordinates, if the ‘coordinate_accuracy’ attribute was over 1000 m, the corresponding coordinates were removed and other location data was favoured.;SSFIKI_130;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The aforementioned language translation technique was applied to the text-form location field, before applying location inference to provide accurate coordinates for mapping (see below).;SSFIKI_131;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) was set up by the Government of Kerala to assist in the rebuilding and recovery efforts after the flood event [46].;SSFIKI_132;Response
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The RKI includes a diverse range of projects, including the development and promotion of the Rebuild Kerala Development Programme, the strategic roadmap for reconstruction across the state.;SSFIKI_133;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Relevant to this study, RKI collected data by surveying affected citizens about property damage and made it publicly available as a database, with each report then verified by a local overseer.;SSFIKI_134;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;From this database, we extracted records for verified flood-damaged houses that were accepted for financial aid by the state government.;SSFIKI_135;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This data is stored in a comma-separated format with each row corresponding to one of the 1034 Kerala local administrative bodies (Municipalities, Corporations, and Gram Panchayats).;SSFIKI_136;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Each record is the number of damaged properties approved for financial support within that local body.;SSFIKI_137;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Manually assigning each location to a corresponding map polygon was the only preprocessing required.;SSFIKI_138;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;"A few assumptions were necessary due to alternative spellings and duplicate place names in the data; however, these are unlikely to make an impact due to the volume of the data.";SSFIKI_139;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;In the dataset, most local bodies had corresponding values in the ‘Total’, ‘Verified’, ‘Approved’ and ‘Rejected’ surveys columns.;SSFIKI_140;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For this work, the difference between the ‘Verified’ and ‘Rejected’ columns was taken as a conservative estimate of the true ‘Approved’ value, as many entries did not have a value for ‘Approved’.;SSFIKI_141;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;2.5 Location inference To find on-the-ground observations rather than long-distance “news” posts, the data was geolocated, keeping only the data located in Kerala.;SSFIKI_142;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Location inference is an automated procedure that identifies place names in the post and then assigns a map polygon (shapefile) for each location.;SSFIKI_143;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To perform this location inference process, a package developed by Arthur et al. [28] was used, which is based on the work of Schulz et al. [53].;SSFIKI_144;PriorWork
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This involved cross-referencing words within a tweet/message/request to various gazetteers (GADM, DBpedia and Geonames [54–56]), before inferring the most likely location.;SSFIKI_145;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Previous work has found this approach to provide highly accurate locations but, due to the lack of ground truth, this is difficult to quantify.;SSFIKI_146;PriorWork
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Manual checks of outcomes were performed on an ad hoc basis to ensure validity throughout the process.;SSFIKI_147;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Due to differences in the platforms, this final filtering step was applied as follows: • Telegram: Location inference was applied to the extracted text from translated messages and images.;SSFIKI_148;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;If this approach was unsuccessful, and if a Kerala landline phone number was present in the message's ‘phone’ attribute, the location could be inferred using the area code as sourced from the Kerala Government website.;SSFIKI_149;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;6 6 https://kerala.gov.in/std-codes.;SSFIKI_150;Metadata
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;• Twitter: Despite the dataset being a geographic collection, manual inspection showed that the exact location discussed in the tweet text frequently did not correspond to the (often large and unspecific) bounding box within the ‘place’ field in tweet metadata.;SSFIKI_151;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While the cause of this is unknown, two potential explanations are from the incorrect entry of the ‘place’ attribute from the user, or from tweets being posted on behalf of someone, with the place tag related to the user location, rather than where they are referring to.;SSFIKI_152;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Therefore, location inference was applied to the tweet text, with a manual sample showing that this approach had a higher accuracy in determining the location referenced by the post than when the ‘place’ attribute was used.;SSFIKI_153;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;If the tweet had geotagged coordinates, and if no location was inferred from the text, these coordinates were taken as the inferred location.;SSFIKI_154;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Kerala Rescue: A similar approach to that used for Twitter was taken, with the user-entered ‘location’ field prioritised over the automated ‘coordinate’ field due to occasional coordinate inaccuracies.;SSFIKI_155;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;These inaccuracies were primarily from requests on behalf of those affected, with the coordinates corresponding to the individual sending out the request, and the ‘location’ field corresponding to the individual in need of help.;SSFIKI_156;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;If geolocating with this approach was unsuccessful, phone area codes were used as with Telegram posts.;SSFIKI_157;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Location inference was not required as the data was reliably located and verified.;SSFIKI_158;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Within the administrative divisions of Kerala, there was ambiguity regarding duplicate place names, resulting in assumptions being made during location inference for the social platforms.;SSFIKI_159;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For instance, there is a district, taluk (administrative subdivision) and city all called Thiruvananthapuram.

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;2.6 Characterising flood impacts When a request was made through Kerala Rescue, the requester had the option to select ‘True’ or ‘False’ concerning several specific needs they may have had.;SSFIKI_162;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The options were for rescue, food, water, medicine, clothes, kitchen utensils and toiletries, with each having a follow-up section for more information.;SSFIKI_163;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For this investigation, the food and kitchen utensils columns were combined due to their similarity, as were the medicine and toiletries columns.;SSFIKI_164;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To compare the specific needs of those using Kerala Rescue to the other platforms, all of the location inferred Telegram messages and Twitter posts (tweets) were manually categorised.;SSFIKI_165;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This categorisation removed messages that were not directly requesting help (i.e. messages providing information/offering help), before categorising the remaining data into the five groups: rescue, food, water, medicine, and clothes.;SSFIKI_166;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;As Kerala Rescue users had the option to select multiple requests (i.e. food and medicine), the categorisation of tweets/telegrams was not limited to single classes.;SSFIKI_167;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The data tended to be relatively easy to categorise, so a single human coder was employed to perform this task.;SSFIKI_168;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To ensure validity, a sample of 50 labelled messages was independently categorised by 3 human coders, finding an almost perfect agreement (Fleiss's Kappa: 0.897, Krippendorff's Alpha: 0.865).;SSFIKI_169;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This was seen as good evidence that the manual coding process was robust.;SSFIKI_170;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;3 Results Fig. 1 shows a time series for the volume of filtered and located messages from Telegram, Twitter, and Kerala Rescue binned into 12-h time intervals from 1st August until 23rd August.;SSFIKI_171;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Kerala Rescue was not created until 12th August so that platform only has data after that date.;SSFIKI_172;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The data from Rebuild Kerala was not timestamped so is not plotted.;SSFIKI_173;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;There is a large difference in the volume of records from each platform, with Kerala Rescue having by far the highest number of relevant posts.;SSFIKI_174;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;All time series follow a similar trend, with a sharp increase in messages/requests from 15th August, peaking around 18th August, before decreasing again. This is consistent with the general consensus that the rainfall peaked in severity around 16th August;SSFIKI_175;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Note that the 12-h period shows apparent decreases in activity during night time (2400–1200), seen most sharply on 17th August.;SSFIKI_176;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Fig. 2 shows filtered and located posts from the four data sources as a choropleth map (heatmap) of Kerala.;SSFIKI_177;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Data is grouped at both district and taluk level to capture administrative units relevant to the region.;SSFIKI_178;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To reflect the uncertainty in location inference at the scale of taluks, a moving average filter was used to assign to each taluk the average value across itself and its neighbouring taluks within the same district.;SSFIKI_179;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This was done for all four data sources.;SSFIKI_180;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;As there was only uncertainty between place names within individual districts and not between multiple districts (as discussed in section 2.5), this filter was applied to each district separately.;SSFIKI_181;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Data from the three timestamped platforms has been restricted to the main flood period between 12th - 23rd August.;SSFIKI_182;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Since the counts between platforms vary considerably, values for each map were linearly scaled into the range [0,1] to create the color scale.;SSFIKI_183;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Qualitatively, there are clear spatial similarities between maps, with two main clusters of activity seen in the taluk-level comparison - the first around Kochi, and the second between Alappuzha and Kollam. There is a visual agreement with these hotspots and the flooded areas identified using satellite imagery by Tiwari et al. [20].;SSFIKI_184;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The activity on Telegram and Twitter is more evenly distributed throughout Kerala, whereas on Kerala Rescue and Rebuild Kerala the activity hotspots are more tightly focused.;SSFIKI_185;Results

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Statistical analysis shows that all pairs of data sources have strong positive correlations at both taluk scale (Pearson's r > 0.69, p < 0.001) and district scale (Pearson's r > 0.76, p < 0.001).;SSFIKI_188;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;District-level correlations are stronger than taluk-level correlations.;SSFIKI_189;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;However, this was anticipated as location inference is more reliable at the larger district scale, where small errors are less important and the data less noisy.;SSFIKI_190;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;To check whether these results are explained as an artefactual consequence of population, with highly populated areas producing a stronger ‘flood signal’ due to larger user populations, we calculated correlations with population size.;SSFIKI_191;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Appendix A.2 shows that observation counts for both taluks (Fig. 2) and districts (Fig. 3) are uncorrelated with population (p > 0.24).;SSFIKI_192;Metadata

SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Fig. 4 shows time series for help requests communicated on the timestamped platforms, alongside time-aggregated distributions of request types.;SSFIKI_193;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Despite the distribution of needs on the platforms being different, the timing of requests across platforms is similar.;SSFIKI_194;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For instance, requests for rescue peak before requests for provisions on all platforms, with the exception of medicine requests through Twitter, where they peak on the same day.;SSFIKI_195;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;From the bar charts, we can see that excluding rescue requests, the distribution of request types on Twitter and Telegram is similar.;SSFIKI_196;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;On all platforms, clothing is the least requested, and excluding Telegram, rescue is the most requested.;SSFIKI_197;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;It is worth mentioning that both Telegram and Twitter contained two additional categories, namely, requests for volunteers and links for financial aid.;SSFIKI_198;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;As these categories were both lower in volume than the others, and were not present in Kerala Rescue, they have been omitted from this analysis.;SSFIKI_199;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Rebuild Kerala has also been excluded as it does not provide additional impact information beyond property damage.;SSFIKI_200;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Table 3 shows a qualitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each platform for measuring flood impacts.;SSFIKI_201;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;It should be noted that these platforms were not used independently of each other, for instance, messages from the same people were found on Telegram, Twitter and Kerala Rescue.;SSFIKI_202;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Additionally, links to Kerala Rescue were widely distributed on Telegram and Twitter.;SSFIKI_203;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Furthermore, these platforms are not the only platforms that were used to report impacts of the Kerala 2018 floods, with others such as WhatsApp being widely used.;SSFIKI_204;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;4 Discussion In this paper, we have compared social media data from two platforms (Twitter and Telegram), as well as one citizen-produced web application (Kerala Rescue) and a governmental disaster relief survey (Rebuild Kerala).;SSFIKI_205;Method
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The aim was to map and characterise the social impacts of the major flood event in Kerala in 2018.;SSFIKI_206;Objective
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Results show that there is good agreement between the outputs from social sensing using Telegram/Twitter, the semi-formal relief requests database of Kerala Rescue, and the formal property damage assessment performed by Rebuild Kerala.;SSFIKI_207;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Data from Twitter and Telegram also showed similarity between the types of impact reported, to the types of help request collated by Kerala Rescue.;SSFIKI_208;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;These findings build confidence that observation using unsolicited social media data can be an effective way to understand the effects of flooding.;SSFIKI_209;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While Kerala Rescue was a platform rapidly created by volunteers specifically to coordinate requests for help during the flood, and might therefore be expected to perform well in this scenario, it is noteworthy that data derived from the general-use social media platforms Twitter and Telegram also show strong correlations with the structured observations provided by Rebuild Kerala.;SSFIKI_210;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This study, therefore, adds to the evidence base (e.g. Arthur et al. [28,29] demonstrating the potential for informal social media data to assist with flood response and impact assessment. Here the use of Telegram data offers additional novelty, since (to our knowledge) this platform has not previously been used for this purpose.;SSFIKI_211;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The Kerala Rescue dataset contains a large amount of highly relevant data about flood impacts, relative to the smaller (post-filtering) volumes and greater ambiguity of data available from Twitter and Telegram. However, Kerala Rescue was a one-off platform, created in the early days of the flood by volunteer software developers.;SSFIKI_212;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This ad hoc and spontaneous aspect to Kerala Rescue may add to its authenticity as a source of on-the-ground observations, but also brings uncertainty in that we do not know how widely it was adopted and by whom. By contrast, Twitter and Telegram both have established user populations in Kerala with an observable history of activity on those platforms.;SSFIKI_213;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This means that while Kerala Rescue is very useful for situational awareness and community organisation during the event, it does not offer an effective “baseline” of activity against which observations can be situated.;SSFIKI_214;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;"For example, it is hard to understand why more requests were made on Kerala Rescue in the Kollam region relative to activity on Twitter and Telegram. This could be due to Kerala Rescue genuinely capturing more impacts in that region, or could just reflect greater adoption of the application in that area; without a historic baseline of platform usage in that area, it is hard to determine.";SSFIKI_215;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;For citizen-generated apps such as Kerala Rescue there is no guarantee that the skilled volunteer workforce that created the app will be replicated in future floods or similar extreme weather events.;SSFIKI_216;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;However, Kerala Rescue shows that such applications can be effective in coordinating relief efforts during the event and also as a data source for post hoc analysis.;SSFIKI_217;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While the social media platforms Twitter and Telegram generate fewer observations of flood impacts in the present case study, they offer a number of contrasting advantages.;SSFIKI_218;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;As referenced above, their established user populations, geographic coverage and generality permit the analysis of the 2018 Kerala flood event in a wider context.;SSFIKI_219;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This might allow the 2018 Kerala floods to be assessed against other flood or weather events at different times or places, or against other types of social disruption, with a reasonably consistent underlying study population.;SSFIKI_220;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;"The use of a temporal baseline allows the severity of an event to be estimated based on the level of social media activity relative to the long-term expected level; cf. identification of storm events using a percentile threshold for social media activity [34].";SSFIKI_221;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The establishment of social media as a routine form of communication avoids any special effort to set up a platform when an event occurs since events are observed within the continual flow of communications.;SSFIKI_222;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Another interesting feature of Twitter and Telegram is that they are relatively unstructured in the ways they support communication between users.;SSFIKI_223;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;They enable conversational interactions between pairs or groups of users, in which a greater depth of understanding can be achieved about an unfolding event.;SSFIKI_224;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;This more natural form of discussion may provide insights that more constrained platforms such as Kerala Rescue do not.;SSFIKI_225;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;The converse of this lack of structured communication is that a greater effort is required to derive robust observations.;SSFIKI_226;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;It is not feasible to manually analyse large datasets that may contain hundreds of thousands of messages, while natural language processing can be difficult to apply successfully for short-form messages such as social media posts.;SSFIKI_227;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;In summary, all of the platforms studied here offer distinct opportunities but also unique drawbacks to resilience planners and flood responders.;SSFIKI_228;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;These are summarised in Table 3 above.;SSFIKI_229;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Twitter and Telegram allow the potential for routine monitoring and can provide highly relevant impact information.;SSFIKI_230;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Kerala Rescue was a crucial platform during the flood, generating flows of highly structured and highly relevant data.;SSFIKI_231;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;However, it was created out of necessity and the next flood, or floods in other areas, could easily use a different platform or coordinate through channels like Telegram or WhatsApp.;SSFIKI_232;Results
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Finally, Rebuild Kerala is probably the most reliable and systematic data collection, but is retrospective, much slower, and focuses on only a single impact type.;SSFIKI_233;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;One important consideration for any systematic usage of social media or other citizen-generated data sources for flood monitoring and emergency response is that of sample bias.;SSFIKI_234;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While Internet penetration and smartphone usage are rapidly increasing in Kerala, India and most other parts of the world, it is still more frequent amongst younger, more affluent and urbanised populations.;SSFIKI_235;Background
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Reliance on such data sources could result in an unintended bias towards their user populations and away from those without access to digital resources.;SSFIKI_236;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Careful management of data and appropriate consideration of bias might help to alleviate some of the harmful effects of such “digital divides”, but should be considered from the outset of any project to operationalise these methodologies.;SSFIKI_237;Recommendation
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;5 Conclusion This paper shows that social sensing via popular social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram, or bespoke platforms like Kerala Rescue, can be a useful way to gather validation data and study flood resilience in India.;SSFIKI_238;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;While social media (typically Twitter) has been studied previously to show that it can generate useful insights around natural disasters, here we have focused on the comparison of different platforms, including novel sources such as Telegram and KeralaRescue, and validation against qualified governmental sources.;SSFIKI_239;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;We have shown that social media sources allow the rapid collection of data from people on the ground which is difficult to gather in other ways.;SSFIKI_240;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;A combination of channels could provide excellent coverage across a range of flood impacts - e.g. routine monitoring of Twitter and Telegram for situational awareness and to pick up early impacts.;SSFIKI_241;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Kerala Rescue or similar could then be used as a central place for the coordination of community action and relief.;SSFIKI_242;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Post-disaster analysis of all data sources, including formal efforts like Rebuild Kerala, could then provide a detailed record of the range of impacts and enable the creation of better flood resilience planning and infrastructure.;SSFIKI_243;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;As the global penetration of the internet and social media increases, we believe this study's methodology is not geographically bound to Kerala and can be of real value in other flood-prone areas.;SSFIKI_244;Conclusion
SSFIKI;Social sensing of flood impacts in India: A case study of Kerala 2018;Additionally, as the platforms are not specifically tailored to flood events, this study's approach could be applied to other extreme weather hazards.;SSFIKI_245;Conclusion

METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Interaction between a line of thunderstorms, the resulting gust front, and extreme airborne grass pollen concentrations were the probable key environmental factors that culminated in the exposure of a large urban population during their evening homeward commute.;METAEH_77;HazardCause
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Extreme airborne grass pollen concentrations are reasonably rare in Melbourne, and are variable from year to year, with some years experiencing no such days, others just a few days, and yet others as many as ten or more.14;METAEH_78;Background
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Several of the environmental features of the event are similar to previous events in Melbourne, such as the occurrence in late spring (November), the involvement of grass pollen, and the association with a thunderstorm-induced gust front or outflow at ground level.7, 8, 13;METAEH_79;Background
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Further, the findings from our study again raise the potential for the allergenic contents of ruptured ryegrass pollen grains to have played a substantial role in this epidemic.6, 7, 8;METAEH_80;Discussion
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Although cumulative daily grass pollen concentrations before Nov 21 generally remained close to average,15 the days of extreme pollen counts earlier in the month might have contributed to the epidemic by priming grass pollen-sensitised patients.16;METAEH_81;Discussion
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Serological characterisation done at two of our own centres suggests a prevalence for ryegrass pollen sensitisation of between 87–100% among individuals affected by the November, 2016, event, with very large mean skin prick wheals (10–11 mm) and very high mean serum specific IgE (55kIU/L).17, 18;METAEH_82;Results
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;We thus conclude that extreme exposure to rye grass allergen is critically relevant to highly-sensitised pollen-allergic individuals, for whom protective measures can and should be pursued.19, 20;METAEH_83;Recommendation
METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;Although several of the environmental factors leading up to and during this event were extreme, we cannot be certain that these and the other factors we describe fully account for the magnitude and severity of the epidemic, and as yet unidentified factors might have been involved.;METAEH_84;Recommendation

METAEH;The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: an investigation of environmental triggers, effect on health services, and patient risk factors;There is also suggestion that climate change might extend pollen seasons worldwide, with an increasing likelihood of extreme weather events such as thunderstorms, the confluence of which might increase the risk of more frequent epidemic thunderstorm asthma events in the future.24;METAEH_86;Background

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Globally, women are vulnerable to extreme poverty because they face a greater burden of unpaid work and have limited access to productive assets (Wanjala, 2021).;DHTXSI_3;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Extreme poverty of women seems to interrelate strongly with infectious diseases, a fact that has motivated several studies to address the link between poverty and risky sexual behaviours through cash transfers targeting adolescent girls (Baird, 2012; Pettifor, 2016).";DHTXSI_4;PriorWork
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Women are disproportionately affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS is currently the leading cause of death worldwide for women aged 15–44 years.;DHTXSI_5;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Young women aged 15–24 are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than their male counterparts and comprise 31% of all new HIV infections in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNAIDS, 2017).;DHTXSI_6;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"In addition, STIs not only affect women and their sexual partners, they are a special concern during pregnancy and pose important public health threats to unborn children since they are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes that include spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, and multiple sequelae in surviving neonates including HIV and STI (Adachi et al., 2018; Silver et al., 2014; Gomez et al., 2013; de Attayade et al., 2011).";DHTXSI_7;PriorWork

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Hence reducing STIs and HIV in women will likely translate into large societal benefits that outweigh the costs of such interventions.;DHTXSI_8;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;While almost 2 million persons become newly infected with HIV each year (UNAIDS, 2017), recent literature has developed an entire conceptual framework in order to better understand the structural drivers of the HIV epidemic among women (Gafos et al., 2020).;DHTXSI_9;PriorWork
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"There are a growing number of studies suggesting that transactional sex – defined as non-marital non-commercial sexual relationships motivated by the implicit assumption that sex will be exchanged for material support or other benefits - is associated with risk of HIV acquisition (Dunkle et al., 2004; Kilburn et al., 2018; Ranganathan et al., 2016).";DHTXSI_10;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"This increased risk can be explained by the partner age difference and the number of different partners of young women engaging in such behaviour (Ranganathan et al., 1999; Collinson et al., 2007).";DHTXSI_11;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Further, when women are in a situation of monetary dependence with respect to a sexual partner, their bargaining power is reduced, which increases the risk of HIV infection (Ranganathan et al., 2017).;DHTXSI_12;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Therefore, transactional and commercial sex, alongside with biological susceptibility, are key behavioural practices responsible for gender inequalities in HIV/AIDS (Stoebenau et al., 2016; UNAIDS, 2017).";DHTXSI_13;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;In a recent literature review, Cust et al. (2021) showed that economic shocks are likely to affect both the extensive margin (the number of people engaging in transactional and commercial sex), the intensive margin (the number of sex acts within a relationship) and the degree of riskiness of sexual intercourses.;DHTXSI_14;PriorWork
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"In fact, a number of economic studies have shown that women who engage in transactional and commercial sex may adopt risky sexual behaviours, like unprotected sex, in order to cope with negative income shocks (Burke et al., 2015; De Walque et al., 2014; Dupas & Robinson, 2012; Robinson & Yeh, 2011, 2012).";DHTXSI_15;PriorWork
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"This is explained by the fact that since men have a stronger preference for unprotected sex acts, there is a positive premium for unprotected sex acts (Arunachalam & Shah, 2013; Rao et al., 2003).";DHTXSI_16;PriorWork
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;As for women engaging in transactional sex, Ranganathan et al. (2017) highlighted that when they are relying on material and financial support of their partner, this power imbalance leads to a higher risk of HIV infection.;DHTXSI_17;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;In addition, women experiencing income shocks may be unable to afford treatment for STIs, making them more vulnerable to HIV since the presence of any STI increases both the risk of new infections among HIV-negative people and the risk of transmission from HIV-positive people (Galvin & Cohen, 2004).;DHTXSI_18;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Economic shocks may also affect immune system directly through increased stress (Segerstrom & Miller, 2004), making them more vulnerable to STIs and HIV.;DHTXSI_19;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Income volatility, as opposed to income level and poverty, has only been examined as a structural driver of HIV in recent years and only six published (Burke et al., 2015; Dinkelman et al., 2008; Dupas & Robinson, 2012; Robinson & Yeh, 2011, 2012; Wilson, 2012) and two unpublished studies (De Walque et al., 2014; Tenikue & Tequame, 2018) have investigated the sexual response of women to negative economic shocks, and among these, three focused on behaviours of sex workers (Dupas & Robinson, 2012; Robinson & Yeh, 2011, 2012).";DHTXSI_20;PriorWork

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Following Burke et al. (2015),1 we consider the relation between droughts and transactional sex and finally between droughts and HIV prevalence.;DHTXSI_31;Method
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;We first consider how this relationship operates for women.;DHTXSI_32;Method
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;First, droughts can generate economic shocks for individuals whose primary income source is agriculture, by affecting agricultural outputs.;DHTXSI_33;Impact
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Droughts may also generate economic shocks more widely through the channel of increasing food prices, but empirical evidence suggests that the effects of recent droughts in Malawi have been concentrated amongst individuals with agricultural incomes (Pauw et al., 2011; Loevinsohn, 2015; World Bank, 2016).";DHTXSI_34;Impact
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;We therefore follow Burke et al.

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Second, we hypothesize that the supply curve for transactional sex shifts outwards in response to an economic shock because it allows women to smooth consumption by raising money quickly (Lo Piccalo et al., 2012).;DHTXSI_36;Objective
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Finally, the risk of HIV is increasing due to potential increase in multiple concurrent sexual partners, disassortative sexual mixing and unprotected sex (Downs & De Vincenzi, 1996; Hertog, 2007; Mah & Halperin, 2010, Ranganathan et al., 1999).";DHTXSI_37;PriorWork

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;The sexual partners of women engaging in transactional sex may also be more likely to be infected with HIV than average since they are older men, with greater material resources, or the clients of sex workers (see Kilburn et al., 2018).;DHTXSI_39;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Power relations and the premium on condom-less sex make unprotected sex acts more likely within transactional relationships than regular relationships (MacPherson et al., 2012; Ranganathan et al., 2017).";DHTXSI_40;Background

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"It may also be that the effect of drought will be smaller for men than for women in the same type of employment, if men are better insured against shocks (Dercon & Krishnan, 2000; Gong et al., 2019).";DHTXSI_46;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;If this is the case, men working in agriculture could also increase their consumption of transactional sex in equilibrium.;DHTXSI_47;Discussion
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Second, a decrease in income will cause an inwards shift in the demand curve for transactional sex.;DHTXSI_48;Impact
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;The equilibrium outcome for consumption of transactional sex depends on the relative sizes of this inwards shift, and the outwards shift in the supply curve.;DHTXSI_49;Method
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Indeed, the increase in supply is likely to push prices down which in turn may maintain or raise the demand for transactional sex by men (even if their own income is reduced), this depending on the price elasticity of transactional sex.;DHTXSI_50;Background
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;"Finally, although transactional sex is primarily considered a risky behaviour for women, engaging in transactional sex may also increase men's risk of contracting HIV, given that they are more likely to have multiple concurrent partners or are less likely to use condoms in transactional relationships (Chopra et al., 2009; Maganja et al., 2007; Serwadda et al., 1992).";DHTXSI_51;Background

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;We find that a drought doubles the likelihood of engaging in transactional sex amongst unmarried young women who work in agriculture but has no effect on sexual behaviour of women working outside agriculture.;DHTXSI_181;Conclusion
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;We were able to identify that this increase in the supply encounter an increased demand for transactional sex that came from both men who worked inside and outside the agricultural sector, although the increase was larger for men outside agriculture, probably because they were less economically affected by the drought than men relying on agriculture.;DHTXSI_182;Discussion
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;In addition, we showed that the increase in risky sexual practices translated into a greater chance of reporting STIs symptoms in the past twelve months especially for women in agriculture and men outside agriculture.;DHTXSI_183;Discussion

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Results highlight the additional vulnerability faced by women relying on agriculture, in particular women who have low education and limited labour opportunities and confirm the results of Chishimba and Wilson (2021) who stress the importance of access to education, assets and non-agricultural opportunities to be able to mitigate the extreme weather events and smooth their consumption.;DHTXSI_185;Discussion
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;Not only these women have harder living conditions and worse access to health care that are both important drivers of HIV (Gafos et al., 2020), but they are also more affected by natural disasters.;DHTXSI_186;Conclusion

DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;DHS data indicate that unfortunately this policy had almost no impact as it hardly reached 3% of the population (only 27 out of 807 interviewed households in our sample received the cash transfer in 2014–2015).;DHTXSI_204;Discussion
DHTXSI;From a drought to HIV: An analysis of the effect of droughts on transactional sex and sexually transmitted infections in Malawi;While different shock coping strategies (cash transfers, food transfers and insurance schemes) could be mobilized by governments, adverse weather events such as droughts impact communities reducing the ability of insurers to offer insurance against these risks and limits the ability of Governments to protect people from these covariant shocks due to the high associated costs required to provide cash transfers to affected communities (in the 2015–2016 drought that hit Malawi 90% of individuals suffered from such natural disaster).;DHTXSI_205;Impact

AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The Saratov oblast, which falls between the two areas, is a top producer of both.;AFSRFD_41;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;It should be noted, however, that winter wheat acreage has been increasing at the expense of spring wheat acreage over the past decade across most of western Russia, owing partly to milder winters and partly to agricultural adaptations by area farmers (Rosstat, USDA-FAS).;AFSRFD_42;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"3 Methods The NASA Land Information Systems (LIS) is a modeling and data assimilation framework for terrestrial earth modeling that allows for integration of modeled and observational data to produce optimal states of land surface variables (e.g., soil moisture) and water and energy fluxes (Kumar et al., 2006; Peters-Lidard et al., 2007).";AFSRFD_43;Method
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;In this paper, we show results of a soil moisture index (SMI, Hunt et al., 2009) from LIS to show the effect of the flash drought on root-zone soil moisture and as a proxy for water stress on the wheat crop.;AFSRFD_44;Method
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"The SMI was generated from the root-zone soil moisture product from the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP; Niu et al., 2011) land surface model, which was run in LIS at 25-km resolution and driven with forcing from the NCEP Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS; Derber et al., 1991), over a 20-year period from 2000 to 2019.";AFSRFD_45;Method
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The index is scaled from −5.0 to 5.0, where −5.0 (5.0) represents the minimum (maximum) water content for a 25-km grid box for a particular period of time, which in this analysis is one-week intervals between mid-April and early September.;AFSRFD_46;Method
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI; Anderson et al., 2007a, 2011; 2013) represents standardized anomalies in the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to potential evapotranspiration (PET), which are generated with the thermal remote sensing-based Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy balance model (Anderson et al., 2007b).";AFSRFD_47;Method
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Negative ESI indicates that normalized ET is lower than normal over a given compositing window (typically 2, 4, 8 or 12 weeks, advancing at 7-day intervals), indicating depleted soil moisture and vegetative stress.;AFSRFD_48;Method
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"ESI values of −2.0 (2.0) represents the bottom (top) 2.5 percent of the distribution; thus, an ESI below −2.0 are typically associated with severe drought conditions.";AFSRFD_49;Method

AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;4.2 Agricultural impacts The flash drought and heat wave that affected much of western Russia in the summer of 2010 had devastating impacts on both the winter and spring wheat crop and the timing of the onset of the flash drought in early June could not have been worse.;AFSRFD_113;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;According to the crop calendar from the USDA-FAS, winter wheat typically enters its flowering period in the most productive oblasts of southwestern Russia around the first week of June.;AFSRFD_114;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Thus, the most critical period for winter wheat yield in places like the Volgograd oblast was marked by an absence of precipitation and a depleted soil moisture profile.;AFSRFD_115;HazardCause
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;In Fig. 2a–b and 3a-b, this period of time fell between the images from 5 June and 3 July respectively.;AFSRFD_116;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;A majority of the top producing oblasts for winter wheat (denoted in Fig. 4 by an asterisk) were more than 40% below trend.;AFSRFD_117;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The most extreme yield departures of more than 50% below trend were found over the oblasts of Saratov, Tambov, and Voronezh.;AFSRFD_118;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Conditions were somewhat less extreme in the far southern portion of Russia where the top winter wheat producing oblast Rostov was 10% below trend and Stavropol was almost at trend.;AFSRFD_119;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Aided by much above average temperatures, the flash drought was in its most rapid intensification phase around the same time flowering began on the spring wheat crop in western Russia in 2010.;AFSRFD_120;HazardCause
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The critical flowering stage likely occurred mostly between late June and early August in Fig. 3a–b.;AFSRFD_121;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Thus, most locations in Regions 1, 3, and 5 where spring wheat is the dominant crop likely had depleted soil moisture and severe drought stress at the start of flowering.;AFSRFD_122;HazardCause
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The flash drought continued to intensify and expand during flowering and the result was almost complete devastation to the spring wheat crop.;AFSRFD_123;HazardCause
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Fig. 5 shows that all oblasts in western Russia were more than 10% below trend and most were at least 50% below trend.;AFSRFD_124;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Perhaps most critically, the area of western Russia with most rapid intensification and extreme conditions (as shown by the ESI in Fig. 2b) occurred over the most productive oblasts for spring wheat, which meant that oblasts such as Saratov and Tatarstan had spring wheat yields that were more than 80% below trend.;AFSRFD_125;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The total combined production of winter and spring wheat in Russia in 2010 was 41.5 million metric tons (MT), a drop of over 20 million MT compared to both 2008 and 2009.;AFSRFD_126;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The impact to production was most acute for the top producing oblasts as well.;AFSRFD_127;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Table 2 shows that most oblasts in the prime winter wheat region (refer to Fig. 1) had at least a 50% reduction in production when compared to the average of 2008–2009.;AFSRFD_128;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The most significant reductions were in Belgorod and Voronezh, with reductions of 75% and 80% respectively.;AFSRFD_129;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The impacts to spring wheat were even more severe with most oblasts having reductions over 75% compared to 2008–2009 and as high as 92% in Saratov.;AFSRFD_130;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The development and intensification of the flash drought not only occurred at the worst possible time for both of these crops in 2010, it also occurred over the most productive wheat producing region of Russia.;AFSRFD_131;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Had this drought developed later in the season or had it been offset to the north or south, the impacts to production likely would have been less severe.;AFSRFD_132;Discussion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The impacts of this flash drought unfortunately were not confined to Russia and the next section gives a broad overview of the international impacts to food security that occurred because of this extreme event.;AFSRFD_133;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;4.3 Impacts to food security By the beginning of August, it was apparent that the flash drought and its associated heat wave were going to lead to significant reduction in both yields (MT ha−1) and total production (MT) of wheat in western Russia.;AFSRFD_134;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The USDA World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimate report in August 2010 noted that expected Russian wheat production would be reduced 8 million MT with additional reductions of 2.5 million MT in neighboring Kazakhstan and Ukraine due to similar conditions as in western Russia.;AFSRFD_135;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This reduction also had a significant impact on the global wheat stocks.;AFSRFD_136;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Between the months of June and August, global demand for wheat remained constant but the supply dropped from 861.4 million MT to 839.8 million MT (USDA-WASDE, 2010).;AFSRFD_137;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Thus, global wheat stocks dropped from 193.9 million MT to 174.7 million MT between June and August (Supplemental Table 3).;AFSRFD_138;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This sharp drop in supply also corresponded with a rapid increase in prices.;AFSRFD_139;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;For example, at the onset of the flash drought in early June, wheat prices were around $170/MT (U.S. dollars).;AFSRFD_140;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;As drought conditions worsened, the price of wheat increased, slowly at first and then rapidly later in July.;AFSRFD_141;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, by early August wheat prices had climbed to almost $300/MT (Bora et al., 2010).;AFSRFD_142;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;While wheat prices were higher in early 2008 and were higher again in 2012, the months of July and August of 2010 are the only occurrence of consecutive months with a 20 percent increase in the global wheat price since at least the mid-1990's.;AFSRFD_143;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The steep rise in global wheat prices in July and early August of 2010 was exacerbated by Russian grain speculators that intentionally kept grain off the market because of expectations of an export ban.;AFSRFD_144;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This anticipation of an export ban by the Russian government came to fruition on 5 August and was a fulfillment of its Food Security Doctrine that was adopted by President Medvedev in January 2010 (Welton 2011).;AFSRFD_145;Response
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The Food Security Doctrine established minimum self-sufficiency standards for Russia, which included being able to produce 95 percent of its grain (including wheat) and potatoes (Lunze et al., 2015).;AFSRFD_146;Response
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Thus, the export ban was implemented to ensure greater self-sufficiency.;AFSRFD_147;Response
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Most Russians did not see a financial benefit from the export ban, however, and the poorest people in the country were particularly affected by the significant increase in prices, as the official price for a subsistence basket rose upwards of 30% in just a few months (Welton 2011).;AFSRFD_148;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;In the decade following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian agricultural policy focused on dramatically increasing grain production as a way of making Russia a key grain exporter.;AFSRFD_149;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Economic nationalism was the key driver of this effort, using protectionism and state investment to boost production prior to the 2010 drought (Wegren 2010).;AFSRFD_150;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;By the late 2000s, therefore, Russia was a net exporter of wheat, and in the years leading up to 2010, countries such as Egypt were significantly dependent on wheat exports from Russia, as well as China and a few other global wheat suppliers.;AFSRFD_151;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;In 2010, the top wheat importers were Egypt and Algeria followed by Brazil, Japan, Korea, Morocco, and the U.S. (Taylor and Koo, 2011).;AFSRFD_152;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Thus, when the Russian government banned the export of wheat in early August 2010, it contributed to an unfortunate chain reaction.;AFSRFD_153;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The Russian wheat ban went into effect shortly before a “once-in-a-century winter drought” in China (Barriopedro et al., 2012), as well as downturns in other major wheat-producing regions.;AFSRFD_154;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;For example, wet and cool conditions affected the amount of wheat planted in parts of Canada (USDA-FAS 2010) and significant drought adversely affected wheat yield in western Australia (Rural Business Development Corporation, 2014).;AFSRFD_155;CascadingHazard
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The reduced production in major wheat growing places like Canada and Western Australia further strained the wheat supply.;AFSRFD_156;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"As a result of wheat supply shortages, global wheat prices doubled between June 2010 to February 2011, from $149/MT to $318/MT (Supplemental Table 4; Werrell et al., 2015).";AFSRFD_157;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;During this time period, high wheat prices prompted the Mozambique government to raise bread prices by 30%, which led to broader social unrest, including food riots with a small number of fatalities (Berazneva and Lee 2013).;AFSRFD_158;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The price of wheat flour increased by 10 percent or more during the July–October 2010 period in Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Afghanistan, Sudan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and Bolivia (World Bank Food Price Watch, 2010).;AFSRFD_159;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Furthermore, the high wheat prices were a factor in a 26 percent increase in the Food Price Index from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) between June and November (Foley 2010).;AFSRFD_160;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Wheat is a very important grain in Egypt and the broader Middle East and North Africa, as it is the base of bread, which is a cultural staple and a large source of calories for poorer populations.;AFSRFD_161;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;As wheat prices rose sharply, bread prices rose 300% by early 2011 across a number of areas of Egypt, straining the capacity of the country's bread subsidy regime, and leading to bread riots in rural areas across the country that coincided with civil unrest in the country's cities – thus broadening the appeal of the anti-Mubarak movement outside urban areas (Femia et al., 2014).;AFSRFD_162;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Welton (2011) reports that this was particularly problematic in Pakistan as a large increase in prices was coupled with the reduction in food protection prices by the government, thereby increasing the poverty rate.;AFSRFD_163;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;It is the combination of the rapid increase in the contract prices for wheat and its byproducts, combined with sustained high prices, that is thought to be a non-trivial factor in expanding the popular appeal of unrest during the Arab Spring (Jones 2012), particularly to rural communities that were highly dependent on bread and vulnerable to price volatility (Lubin 2011).;AFSRFD_164;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"This is not to imply that high wheat prices alone were directly responsible for the Arab Spring; rather they were a complicating factor in a region plagued with persistent poverty and inequality (Ianchovichina et al., 2015; Klasen 2018).";AFSRFD_165;Discussion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The event was also a reminder that the balance between agricultural ‘food security’ and global trade in Russia is a tenuous one (Wegren and Elvstad 2018).;AFSRFD_166;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Russia's long and painful history of famine still weighs heavily on the population.;AFSRFD_167;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;In 2015, Russia's President Putin ordered the destruction of banned western food imports, which sparked a rare public backlash because it revived memories of food shortages during the Soviet era (Baczynska 2015).;AFSRFD_168;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;While the Russian state was able to intervene in 2010 to subsidize farmers and stabilize the grain supply through the use of reserves, it is uncertain whether the regime could mollify a population with a fear of shortages through multiple seasons.;AFSRFD_169;Background
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This uncertainty could be exacerbated by extreme events made more probable by climate change.;AFSRFD_170;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Finally, the cascading socioeconomic impacts that occurred in 2010–2011 might offer us a warning and possibly some clues about the stakes of climate change in increasingly tenuous geopolitical times.;AFSRFD_171;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;5 Discussion and closing thoughts The occurrence of extreme drought and heat over a large agricultural region, such as western Russia, is by definition an unusual meteorological event.;AFSRFD_172;Results
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The timing of the development of the flash drought and the locations affected by the flash drought were very important to the food security crisis.;AFSRFD_173;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The onset of the flash drought was such that both spring wheat and winter wheat crops in western Russia had very low available soil moisture and unusually warm temperatures during the critical flowering stage.;AFSRFD_174;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"Previous research (Miralles et al., 2014; Schumacher et al., 2019; Christian et al., 2020) has demonstrated the desiccated agricultural landscape also exacerbated the magnitude and the persistence of the heat wave in late July and August 2010, leading to additional yield loss.";AFSRFD_175;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Furthermore, this flash drought and heat wave affected the most productive places for winter and spring wheat in Russia, thereby compounding the production losses.;AFSRFD_176;HazardCause
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;If the flash drought had begun six weeks later, the impact to winter wheat likely would have been minimized and the impact to spring wheat would have been less substantial as moisture would have been more adequate going into flowering.;AFSRFD_177;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Likewise, if the epicenter of the flash drought had been offset to the north by 500 km, the impacts to agriculture would have been lower because the highly productive oblasts for both winter and spring wheat would have either been outside the drought or on the periphery.;AFSRFD_178;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;As it was, the flash drought and heat wave affected the most productive wheat areas at the worst possible time.;AFSRFD_179;HazardCause
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This was the most extreme regional drought in decades (Welton, 2011) and the relative novelty of the extreme flash drought had unusually severe societal consequences.;AFSRFD_180;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;At least two impacts can be directly attributed to the 2010 flash drought over western Russia (Christian et al., 2020).;AFSRFD_181;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The first was the significant loss of life (i.e., over 11,000 excess deaths) from the heat wave and air quality impacts from the forest fires that followed the flash drought.;AFSRFD_182;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The second was a reduction of over 20 million MT of wheat (a reduction of 34%) compared to the previous two years produced by Russia.;AFSRFD_183;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The spooked reaction in the markets to the anticipation of a significant reduction of wheat and the expectation of an export ban by the Russian government was perhaps the first food security domino to fall between the summer of 2010 and the spring of 2011.;AFSRFD_184;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;The next food security domino also had its connection to drought.;AFSRFD_185;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;An extreme drought that developed over eastern China (Barriopedro et al., 2012) also contributed significantly to the disorder and panic-buying in the grain markets in early 2011.;AFSRFD_186;Impact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;As discussed in Werrell et al. (2015), the combination of these two droughts contributed to a doubling of the global price of wheat between June 2010 and February 2011.;AFSRFD_187;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This made bread unaffordable in many countries, leading to increased poverty, bread riots and may have been a contributing factor to regime change in countries such as Egypt and Tunisia during the Arab Spring.;AFSRFD_188;CascadingImpact
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Extreme droughts are part of natural variability but the exceptional nature of the flash drought in Russia in 2010 may be a warning sign that rapidly intensifying flash droughts may become more common due to climate change (Rahmstorf and Coumou, 2012).;AFSRFD_189;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;Furthermore, flash droughts may be more likely to occur in some of the globe's most productive agricultural regions in the same calendar year (Anderson et al., 2017), which could generate cascading impacts that would affect global good security.;AFSRFD_190;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;"For example, a repeat of the 1936 drought in the central U.S. (Cook et al., 2008, 2009; Peters and Burruss, 2020; Hunt et al., 2020; Bolles et al., 2021) coupled with simultaneous production losses of maize and soybean in Brazil (Anderson et al., 2017) could potentially have severe consequences for global food security.";AFSRFD_191;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;As was the case with the Russia flash drought in 2010, if it led to panic in the global markets, a hypothetical argument could be made that numerous countries would independently enact export bans to protect their own supply.;AFSRFD_192;Conclusion
AFSRFD;Agricultural and food security impacts from the 2010 Russia flash drought;This in turn likely would lead to drastic price increases for maize and soybean and significant disruption to the supply chain. Authorship Eric Hunt:;AFSRFD_193;Conclusion

PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Cross-sectional studies on mental health conse- quences from natural disasters are likely to share common shortcomings.;PHM1YR_96;Recommendation
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;An inevitable selection bias is introduced, since some individuals died from the disaster.;PHM1YR_97;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Recall bias represents another problem. In addition, those suffering from mental distress after the disaster might be more likely to report negative events.;PHM1YR_98;Recommendation
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;For example, the finding that more people with previous mental health problems than those without a history of such problems reported that their houses had been completely or partly destroyed is likely to be accounted for by recall or report bias.;PHM1YR_99;Recommendation
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Another, probably more important, shortcoming of our study has to do with sample selection.;PHM1YR_100;Recommendation
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;The fact that the sample was recruited from primary health care patients obviously makes it difficult to generalise our findings to the community.;PHM1YR_101;Recommendation
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;It is well known, and we have shown in previous studies in the area, that mental health problems are aggregated in a primary health care setting [5].;PHM1YR_102;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Few previous studies have dealt with disasters in low-income countries, and comparisons with previ- ous ®ndings from other settings have to be viewed cautiously.;PHM1YR_103;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;The overall prevalence of 9% among PHC patients in the most severely affected area corresponds to a reported prevalence of 9.5% from the Exxon Valdez oil spill [2] and to reported figures among adolescents after hurricane Andrew [6].;PHM1YR_104;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Our study was conducted on primary health care patients, where prevalence is expected to be higher, but in a similar community-based study in Honduras, which used the same instruments, prevalence was also roughly estimated at around 9% +Kohn, personal communication 1999).;PHM1YR_105;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;This prevalence figure is also of interest in light of similar prevalences reported among individuals exposed to personal traumatic events [7].;PHM1YR_106;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Other studies that have reported much higher prevalences, e.g. 35±60% after an earthquake in Armenia and among adults after hurricane Andrew, have been based on samples less adequate for prevalence estimation, since they were neither population-based nor selected for prevalence purposes;PHM1YR_107;PriorWork
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;A specific aim of this study was to increase knowledge about who is at risk for developing long- term PTSD sequelae, to allow for focused early intervention.;PHM1YR_108;Objective
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Our findings correspond in general with previous findings, but there are also interesting differences.;PHM1YR_109;Conclusion
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;In accordance with almost all previous studies, trauma severity, previous mental health problems and female sex were associated with higher risk for long-standing mental health problems.;PHM1YR_110;Conclusion
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;There are reports that people under 35 years are at particular risk [10], but no particular age group showed higher risk in our study.;PHM1YR_111;Conclusion
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Epstein and co-workers [11] reported that those with a lower educational level were more likely to develop PTSD after an air disaster, but otherwise reports on educational level are scant in studies from the Western world.;PHM1YR_112;PriorWork
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;In our study, illiteracy turned out to be signi®cantly related to long-standing PTSD problems.;PHM1YR_113;Conclusion
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;This is even more important, since the illeterates were in general less likely to seek help.;PHM1YR_114;Results
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;An underlying explanation for both these findings could be that those with illiteracy are more likely to live in more isolated areas, with longer distances to places where help can be sought, and illiteracy may also be a proxy for poor social conditions in general and poor health in general.;PHM1YR_115;Discussion
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;The high proportion of PTSD cases at 6 months who were still cases at 12 months (50%) is in accordance with previous studies and further under- scores the severity of the disorder.;PHM1YR_116;Conclusion
PHM1YR;Psychological impact of the hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua in a one-year perspective;Epstein and co-workers [11] found that the prevalence of PTSD increased from 7.5% 6 months after an air disaster to 12.1% after 1 year.;PHM1YR_117;PriorWork

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Introduction Freshwater resources are becoming increasingly limited in many parts of the world, not only in arid regions, but also in humid and temperate regions where rainfall is typically abundant (Pereira et al., 2002).;DNEAWR_1;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"Because irrigated agriculture is a leading consumer of freshwater resources globally (Calzadilla et al., 2010; FAO, 2011) and in the United States, where agriculture accounts for 80% of national surface and ground water consumption (Gollehon and Quinby, 2006), understanding current and future agricultural water use is crucial to maintaining viable water and agricultural resources.";DNEAWR_2;Motivation
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"Although irrigation is used more frequently in arid regions, supplemental irrigation is often economical and used in humid regions to optimize production and buffer effects of rainfall variability (Rey et al., 2016; Wriedt et al., 2009; Oweis, 2005; Wilks and Wolfe, 1997).";DNEAWR_3;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"For instance, in the Southeastern United States, where average annual precipitation is over 130cm (Nuti and Lamb, 2009), irrigation of crops has increased considerably over the years due both to uncertainty associated with rainfall amounts and distribution as well as the fact that supplemental irrigation increases yields and profits (Salazar et al., 2012; Lamb et al., 2011).";DNEAWR_4;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;In the Northeastern United States (Northeast), field crops and pasture are rain-fed, while many fruit and vegetable farmers have some irrigation equipment to supplement summer rainfall, typically moveable sprinklers for most crops and drip systems for some apple orchards.;DNEAWR_5;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;The Northeast does not have an elaborate infrastructure for water delivery to farms via canals or ditches as is common in some arid regions.;DNEAWR_6;Results
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Farmers instead pump from local streams, farm ponds, or wells and the irrigation capacity at the regional and farm level is not established to cope with prolonged summer drought (S. Fickbohm, New York Agriculture and markets, personal communication, 2017).;DNEAWR_7;Method
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"The Northeast is representative of many temperate and historically humid regions, where climate projections for longer frost-free periods and warmer summer temperatures (Hartman et al., 2013) may have both positive and negative effects on land suitable for agriculture (Zhang and Cai, 2011; Teixeira et al., 2013) and crop productivity (Tebaldi et al., 2006; Hatfield et al., 2011).";DNEAWR_8;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Specifically in the Northeast, growing seasons in the last two decades are ∼10days longer compared to the first half of the 20th century (Walsh et al., 2014), and summer temperatures have increased by ∼0.07±0.01°C per decade since 1900 (Hayhoe et al., 2007).;DNEAWR_9;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;These trends are likely to continue, with end of the century projections for the Northeast of an additional 20–50 frost free days per growing season (Walsh et al., 2014) and an increase of 3–7°C during summer months (Horton et al., 2014), depending on the emissions scenario.;DNEAWR_10;PriorWork

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"While this may allow farmers to explore new markets and higher yielding crop varieties (Wolfe et al., 2008), climate projections for the region suggest the occurrence of extremely high temperatures (i.e. heat stress) and short-term summer droughts are likely to become more frequent (Hayhoe et al., 2007; Horton et al., 2014), with negative effects on yields (Wolfe et al., 2011; Walthall et al., 2012).";DNEAWR_11;HazardDescription
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"Most climate projections for the Northeast suggest that total annual precipitation will remain relatively stable, possibly with small decreases in summer months and small increases in winter months (Hayhoe et al., 2007; Horton et al., 2014).";DNEAWR_12;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Some of the increased precipitation in winter months, however, is likely to be in the form of rainfall and not snowfall, reducing the winter snowpack (Hayhoe et al., 2007).;DNEAWR_13;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;"In fact, this trend of a reduced winter snowpack has already been observed in the Northeast (Frumhoff et al., 2007; Horton et al., 2011).";DNEAWR_14;PriorWork
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Further, more of the rain that does come in summer months will likely be in the form of heavy precipitation events, defined as events with more than 5–10cm of rainfall at daily timescales (Horton et al., 2011).;DNEAWR_15;HazardDescription
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;The frequency of heavy precipitation events has already increased by 71% in the Northeast over the last 50 years, and such events are projected to occur two to five times more often by the end of the century (Walsh et al., 2014).;DNEAWR_16;HazardDescription
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;If more growing season precipitation comes in heavy rain events, yet the total annual amount of precipitation does not change much, it is possible that those heavy rain events will be interspersed with longer dry periods.;DNEAWR_17;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;These climate changes (higher temperatures, longer growing seasons, and longer dry periods) will increase drought risk.;DNEAWR_18;CascadingHazard

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;This, combined with the fact that farmers are recognizing the economic importance of irrigation even in humid regions, suggests that agricultural water use is likely to increase in the future in regions such as the Northeast.;DNEAWR_20;CascadingImpact
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;In this study, we evaluate the severity and impacts of the 2016 drought in New York State (NY) as a case study relevant to identifying water resource vulnerabilities of the region to a changing climate where the risk of drought and agricultural water use may increase with climate change.;DNEAWR_21;Objective
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;To see how the 2016 drought compared to historical climatological and hydrological conditions across NY, as well as to examine the risk of future droughts, we analyzed 60 years of snowfall, precipitation, air temperature, and streamflow data.;DNEAWR_22;Method
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;To better understand how the drought affected the agricultural sector and whether or not farmers in NY were able to cope with drought, we surveyed and interviewed farmers across the state.;DNEAWR_23;Method
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Lastly, to get a sense of possible ecological implications in terms of water use during a drought, we modeled potential agricultural crop irrigation water use in both “average” years (mean of last 15 years) and in 2016 (which is representative of a relatively severe drought year).;DNEAWR_24;Method
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Modelling crop irrigation water use in a state such as NY is important because, although NY is one of the leading producers of many agricultural commodities nationally and the top agricultural producer in the Northeast (DiNapoli, 2015), agricultural water use in NY is not well understood because water withdrawals in NY remain relatively unregulated.;DNEAWR_25;Motivation
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;For instance, only systems capable of withdrawing 380cubic meters per day of water (surface or groundwater or combination of the two) are regulated (NY DEC, 2012).;DNEAWR_26;Background

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;What made the 2016 drought unique, particularly in Western NY, was a historically low amount of snowfall in the winter preceding the 2016 growing season and record low streamflows, reflecting depleting groundwater supplies.;DNEAWR_139;HazardDescription
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;These conditions led to yield reductions even on farms with irrigation because of lack of water supply (e.g. dry streams, ponds, or wells), as well as inadequate irrigation equipment on the farm to keep up with crop water demand.;DNEAWR_140;Impact

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;The economic impacts highlighted by the 2016 NY drought were associated primarily with lack of irrigation capacity and/or lack of water supply.;DNEAWR_149;HazardCause
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;We found, for instance, that although rainfed crops suffered greater losses than irrigated crops, there were considerable losses of irrigated crops as well, reflecting the inability at the farm level to keep up with crop water demand on irrigated acres during the drought.;DNEAWR_150;Results
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Further, the infrastructure at the regional level to move water from nearby lakes and canals (which maintained significant quantities of water even in 2016) to the farms was inadequate in some cases.;DNEAWR_151;Results

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;The ecological vulnerabilities for humid regions are associated with the potential for increased water use by the agricultural sector, with possible implications for other water users and natural areas.;DNEAWR_154;Impact
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Our water use estimates suggest the potential for increases of ∼200 to 700% in crop irrigation water use in exceptionally dry years if farmers had capacity to fully meet crop water demand.;DNEAWR_155;Impact
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Future planning for agricultural water use in NY is confounded by the fact that current use is poorly documented, even though NY is one of the leading producers of many agricultural commodities nationally and the top agricultural producer in the Northeast (DiNapoli, 2015).;DNEAWR_156;Background
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Agricultural water use reporting in NY is required only for farms using over 380cubic meters per day for 30 consecutive days, or 11,400cubic meters in one month (NY DEC, 2012).;DNEAWR_157;Background

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Survey results suggest that a majority of NY farmers believe the type of drought they experienced in 2016 may occur more frequently in the future and are already investing in irrigation equipment and water sources to be able to increase irrigation capacity.;DNEAWR_165;CascadingImpact
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Also, there is the possibility for agricultural expansion in humid regions, putting further strain on water resources, as water shortages in other regions become relatively more severe (Zhang and Cai, 2011).;DNEAWR_166;Impact

DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;Further, our estimates of drought year crop water use represent a potential, in that we assume all acres reported as “irrigated” by USDA census within any county will be irrigated to fully replenish crop water deficits (i.e. actual crop evapotranspiration less rainfall).;DNEAWR_171;Method
DNEAWR;Anatomy of the 2016 drought in the Northeastern United States Implications for agriculture and water resources in humid climates;This may overestimate water use since currently most farmers do not have the capacity (equipment, supply, or labor) to fully meet crop water demand, particularly in a drought year such as 2016.;DNEAWR_172;Results

WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Compared with PM2.5 measurements from monitoring stations, OSSEM estimates had better performance than FireWork, which may partially be due to OSSEM being a retrospective empirical model based in part on monitoring data and FireWork being a predictive chemical transport model.;WPMSCA_120;Discussion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);A performance evaluation of FireWork compared to ground measurements for the 2015 fire season reported that although hourly PM2.5 concentrations had some over- or under-prediction bias in areas of active fires, Firework captured the temporal variability of episodic PM2.5 events (correlation coefficients of 0.41–0.69) (Pavlovic et al., 2016).;WPMSCA_121;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);As anticipated the differences in estimated wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations between the models resulted in differences in the respective health impact analyses.;WPMSCA_122;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);These differences in air quality model performance highlight the potential for over- or under-estimation of the health impacts, especially when large population centres are affected by smoke plumes.;WPMSCA_123;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);This was particularly evident in the extreme wildfire seasons of 2017 and 2018 where the health impacts calculated using the estimates from OSSEM and FireWork diverged considerably.;WPMSCA_124;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);These observations regarding agreement between FireWork and OSSEM and performance of each model compared with surface measurements are similar to those previously reported (Yuchi et al., 2016).;WPMSCA_125;PriorWork

WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);This study has some limitations and uncertainties associated with the air quality modelling and the health impact analysis.;WPMSCA_128;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Firstly, FireWork is a forecasting model which has some inherent limitations for the current application.;WPMSCA_129;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);However, FireWork currently represents the best national tool available to estimate wildfire-PM2.5 concentrations across Canada, allowing for an analysis of population exposure and the associated air pollution health impacts.;WPMSCA_130;Discussion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);For the air quality modelling, some differences were noted between the wildfire-PM2.5 estimates derived from FireWork, OSSEM, and surface measurements.;WPMSCA_131;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);FireWork is based on a 10 km × 10 km grid and is anticipated to underestimate near-source concentrations due to the assumption of uniform emissions within a grid cell.;WPMSCA_132;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);"Additionally, model predictions of PM2.5 from FireWork are influenced by emissions factors and the plume-rise parameterization, both of which are areas of improvement and refinement within the model (Munoz-Alpizar et al., 2017; Pavlovic et al., 2016).";WPMSCA_133;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);FireWork incorporates wildfire emissions to existing sources also contained in GEM-MACH, an operational forecasting model.;WPMSCA_134;Method
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Thus, the difference between model predictions from FireWork and GEM-MACH allows for estimation of wildfire-specific PM2.5.;WPMSCA_135;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);In comparison, OSSEM is an empirical model that has been optimized for wildfire smoke (Yao and Henderson, 2014), which may not reflect the total PM2.5 from all sources.;WPMSCA_136;Discussion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Due to different considerations for the non-fire sources of PM2.5 in the models, the difference between OSSEM estimates and the GEM-MACH estimates may not accurately reflect the concentration of wilfdfire-PM2.5.;WPMSCA_137;Discussion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);More research is needed to address measurement error in the estimation of wildfire pollutant exposure.;WPMSCA_138;Conclusion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);A key assumption in this study is that the concentration-response relationships used in the health impact analysis that are derived from the epidemiological literature on ambient PM2.5 are applicable for wildfire-PM2.5.;WPMSCA_139;Conclusion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Presently, the epidemiological evidence is insufficient to develop wildfire-specific CRFs, which may reflect different relationships or shapes compared to those for ambient PM2.5 as wildfire events can lead to episodes of highly elevated PM2.5 levels and the chemical composition of wildfire-PM2.5 may be different from that of ambient PM2.5.;WPMSCA_140;Conclusion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);In the absence of wildfire-specific CRFs, it was considered appropriate to utilize the CRFs derived from the well-developed ambient PM2.5 epidemiological literature, similar to the approaches taken by Fann et al. (2018)and Johnston et al. (2012).;WPMSCA_141;PriorWork
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Wildfire-PM2.5 is a contributor to ambient levels of PM2.5, and in Canada is estimated to be the largest contributor (Meng et al., 2019).;WPMSCA_142;Impact
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);However, the relative contribution by the different sources of ambient PM2.5 to the observed health effects is unknown, so the health impacts attributable to wildfire-PM2.5 may have been over- or under-estimated in the present study.;WPMSCA_143;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);"Experimental studies have indicated that wildfire smoke likely leads to adverse health effects via oxidative stress and inflammatory responses (Reid et al., 2016; Naeher et al., 2007), similar to mechanisms understood for ambient PM; however, the evidence is limited for wildfire smoke compared with that for ambient PM.";WPMSCA_144;PriorWork
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Furthermore, although the health effects of wildfire smoke are mainly associated with the PM2.5 component (Reid et al., 2019), this is only one part of the complex smoke mixture, which contains many different chemicals with known health effects.;WPMSCA_145;Background
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Recent research has indicated that biomass fuel type and combustion conditions impact the relative toxicity of smoke (Kim et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2018).;WPMSCA_146;PriorWork
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Additional research is necessary to identify and evaluate any potential health impacts from the other components of wildfire smoke.;WPMSCA_147;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);In estimating potential impacts of chronic exposure to wildfire-PM2.5, it was assumed that increases in annual average exposures due to limited-duration spikes in PM2.5during wildfire season are equivalent to the same annual averages derived from relatively consistent concentrations through the year.;WPMSCA_148;Discussion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);While evidence to support this assumption is currently lacking, the CRF employed for all-cause mortality (Crouse et al., 2012) was based on the national Canadian exposure experience, including exposure from wildfire smoke.;WPMSCA_149;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Although Crouse et al. (2012) did not span the years included in the present analysis, a recently published study examining exposure and mortality through 2016 reported a similar hazard ratio (Christidis et al., 2019).;WPMSCA_150;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Additionally, a recent analysis indicated that wildfire-PM2.5 accounted for 17% of the population-weighted PM2.5exposure in Canada for 2013 (Meng et al., 2019).;WPMSCA_151;PriorWork
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Other exposure metrics, (e.g. peak exposure or number of fires), could potentially better reflect health risks, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support other approaches to exposure assessment.;WPMSCA_152;Discussion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Given that wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense in Canada (Coogan et al., 2019), ongoing work is needed to evaluate how wildfires impact the long term-exposures and the associated health status of Canadians.;WPMSCA_153;Recommendation
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Conclusions This study represents the first Canadian, national assessment of the health impacts due to wildfire smoke.;WPMSCA_154;Conclusion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Wildfire smoke is a major source of PM2.5 in Canada and varies considerably year-to-year and geospatially.;WPMSCA_155;Results
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Smoke from wildfires impacts populations in close proximity to the wildfire activity, but also populations at a distance due to long-range transport of air pollutants.;WPMSCA_156;Impact
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);For 2013–15 and 2017–18, annual premature mortality attributable to wildfire-PM2.5 was estimated at 54–240 mortalities from short-term exposure and 570–2500 mortalities from long-term exposure, as well as many cardiorespiratory morbidity outcomes.;WPMSCA_157;Impact
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);The economic valuation of the population health impacts was estimated per year at $410M-$1.8B for acute health impacts and $4.3B-$19B for chronic health impacts for the study period.;WPMSCA_158;Impact
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Although some limitations and uncertainties were noted for the air quality modelling and health impact analysis, these would be anticipated to decrease with model refinement as well as development of wildfire-specific CRFs.;WPMSCA_159;Conclusion
WPMSCA;Health impact analysis of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke in Canada (2013–2015, 2017–2018);Understanding the population health impacts of wildfire smoke is important as climate change is anticipated to increase wildfire activity in Canada and abroad.;WPMSCA_160;Conclusion

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Heatwaves have increased in frequency and intensity across the globe [5] and in Australia [6] in recent decades, with a concomitant increase in heat-related deaths, a trend projected to continue under most future climate scenarios [7,8], with potential increases of 10–50 additional heatwave days by the end of this century [9].;HFA200_8;PriorWork
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Increasing temperature extremes are one of the most consistent and highest-confidence signals from climate model projections [10], with the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report [11] showing a faster warming trend than previously thought.;HFA200_9;PriorWork
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;While human populations are able to acclimatise to increasing temperatures to some degree (e.g. Ref.

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Australian studies [1,14,15] suggest that, with the exception of disease epidemics, extreme heat events are the most important natural hazard in Australia in terms of human mortality.;HFA200_11;Background
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Coates et al. [1] also noted that Australia's population growth has occurred in tandem with greater urbanisation and increasing housing density.;HFA200_12;Background

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Another risk factor is Australia's ageing population: by 2066, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) projects the population to grow from 24.6 million (at 30 June 2017) to between 37.4 and 49.2 million, the proportion of people aged over 64 to rise from 15% to 21–23% of the population and those over 84 to rise from 2.0% to 3.6–4.4% of the population [17].;HFA200_15;Background

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Global epidemiological studies have demonstrated that impacts of extreme heat are felt disproportionately within society, the most important risk factors beyond age being pre-existing medical conditions, chronic mental disorders, social isolation, low-economic status, homelessness and strenuous outdoor activities (e.g., Refs. [[1], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [84], [85], [86]]).;HFA200_17;PriorWork
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Socio-economic and physiological risk factors often overlap, and many of the most vulnerable groups also live in sub-standard housing poorly adapted to extreme heat (e.g., Refs.

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Health impacts tend to occur when temperatures significantly higher than usual persist for three days or longer [29,30].;HFA200_20;Background
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;One of the most widely used metrics, the Excess Heat Factor (EHF), is the basis for Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) heatwave warning system [31,32].;HFA200_21;Background
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;The EHF index identifies conditions significantly hotter than usual by calculating mean temperatures over a three-day window as an anomaly relative to the long-term 95th percentile: EHFsig.;HFA200_22;Data

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;EHF is then calculated as the product of EHFsig and EHFacc (see Ref. [31]. Any EHF above zero indicates heatwave conditions. The index has been found by Scalley et al. [33] to be a good predictor of the implications of heatwaves for health services. The EHF is location-specific: in order to develop a severity rating scheme suitable for comparison across locations, Nairn and Fawcett [31] proposed normalising the EHF by the location-specific 85th percentile to produce an EHF severity index (EHFsev).;HFA200_24;Method

HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;Diagnosing heat deaths is problematic, as staff responsible for recording cause of death (see Ref. [35] may not consider heat a potential cause. Haynes et al. [36] identified this during the 2009 Southern Australian heatwave, where attending officers did not collect sufficient evidence at the scene (such as temperature in the home or the use of air-conditioning) in order to correctly attribute or exclude extreme heat as a cause of death.;HFA200_30;PriorWork
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;With respect to coronial records, it is not generally possible to identify heat-related deaths through autopsy alone: the circumstances around the death must also be understood.;HFA200_31;Background
HFA200;Heatwave fatalities in Australia, 2001–2018: An analysis of coronial records;The Coroner/forensic pathologist must base cause of death only on those facts known to them. Thus, if the circumstances are unknown then, even though the forensic pathologist may state that, at the time of death, there was extreme environmental heat, no heat-related terms will be included in the cause of death.;HFA200_32;Background

Raw numbers of fatalities were normalised by viewing the fatality numbers against a background population of the particular group of interest. Normalisation enables the comparison of fatalities over time and across jurisdictions, by taking into account any increases in population over time and population differences from place to place. The ABS estimated resident population by age and gender [48] for FY2001-FY2018 was used to calculate fatality rates per 100,000 population. The annual fatality rates were then used to derive the average FY2001-FY2018 rate. There is no guarantee that this method will identify all heat-related deaths that occurred FY2001-FY2018: 1. Heatwaves can exacerbate pre-existing medical conditions as well as killing outright and, often, a death is coded under the primary cause of death: e.g., cardiac arrest 2.

The true influence of this data on the interpretations from this analysis is unknown but is likely to result in an under-estimate of the number of heatwave fatalities. In addition, data available for analysis in accessed coronial files was limited, in that Australian jurisdictions deal with data destined for coronial files in different ways: thus, data collected varies between jurisdictions and over time.

ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;Our natural experiment has several strengths.;ABFPA_126;Conclusion
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;We used device-measured physical activity and were able compare cohorts of children with no exposure to bushfire smoke to cohorts of children who experienced severe smoke exposure.;ABFPA_127;Method
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;These cohorts were relatively homogenous and by using propensity score matching we further reduced bias arising from confounders.;ABFPA_128;Method
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;Because smoke levels at specific schools varied daily, we were also able to analyse within-child relationships between daily air quality and daily physical activity.;ABFPA_129;Method

ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;We were not able to differentiate between outdoor and indoor physical activity.;ABFPA_134;Recommendation
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;It is possible that indoor physical activity replaced outdoor physical activity in accord with public health advice.;ABFPA_135;Recommendation
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;This, however, seems unlikely because when there were very large increases in AQI, we observed large decreases in physical activity.;ABFPA_136;Discussion
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;This suggests indoor physical activity did not compensate for missed outdoor opportunities.;ABFPA_137;Discussion
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;Also, in Australia, children’s physical activity environments and opportunities tend to be outdoor orientated.;ABFPA_138;Background
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;For example, most schools’ play spaces and sporting facilities are outdoors and Australia’s most popular sports are played outdoors (Australian Sports Commission, 2019).;ABFPA_139;Background
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;Another limitation relates to our assignment of daily AQI readings to individuals using data from the monitoring station nearest to their school.;ABFPA_140;Recommendation
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;While this is the standard approach to studies of air pollution and health, it assumes that children also lived near their school and we acknowledge that individual exceptions could contribute to exposure misclassification. The effect of wind direction on smoke could also influence exposure accuracy.;ABFPA_141;Recommendation
ABFPA;The effects of the Australian bushfires on physical activity in children;Wind could have moved smoke over monitoring stations but not over nearby schools.;ABFPA_142;Recommendation

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;These results reasonably indicate that heavy rains brought about significant health deterioration in individuals majorly affecting blood and urine physiology.;HR2018_47;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;3.2 Analysis of physiological changes across gender We further compared all the clinical values of pre-disaster (2017) and disaster-hit (2018) years across the gender to assess whether disaster-induced physiological differences are biased for either males or females.;HR2018_48;Method
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;There was however no significant change observed for any of the given clinical values, indicating both the males or female victims have suffered health issues with almost similar magnitude (Table 2 ).;HR2018_49;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;3.3 Multivariate regression analysis In the further step, stepwise multivariate regression with forward selection wrappers was performed to identify the association of clinical factor (s) confounding for disaster-induced deterioration of health in victims.;HR2018_50;Method
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;"A close perusal of the regression results (Table 3 ) shows that urine protein to be significantly altered (R2 = 0.518; step 1 of the regression analysis), indicating the victims accumulated higher urine protein in the course and following the disaster.";HR2018_51;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;"Further, apart from a significant change in the urine protein concentration, disaster-hit changes in physiological variates like WBC, RBC, Hb, Hct, HDL, γGTP, Alb, BUN, UA, BS, HbA1C was also observed, nevertheless, even in combination, contributed considerably less to increase the overall fitness of the regression model (R2 = 0.593; step 12 of the regression analysis).";HR2018_52;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;The results of logistic regression hence suggest that, although the change in the aforementioned physiological variates impacts disaster-induced deterioration of health, however, not significantly as compared to urine protein. 3.4 Urine protein analysis Since urine protein showed a significant increase in victims due to heavy rains against pre-disaster year, we further performed a detailed logistic analysis to comprehend the extent to which it affected the victims.;HR2018_53;Method

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;It was interesting to note that, in the disaster-hit year, only 56.45 % out of 728 individuals had normal urine concentration levels (Level 0), as against 88.46 % in the pre-disaster year.;HR2018_55;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Further, the mean concentration of the urine protein abruptly increased by 4.5 fold in victims following the disaster (Table 4 and Figure 2 ).;HR2018_56;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;In a further approach, we performed logistic regression comparing the normal levels of urine protein (level 0) with increased levels (levels 1, 2,3 and 4) in victims.;HR2018_57;Method
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;As anticipated, higher levels of urine protein levels were found in the disaster-hit year (Table 5 & Figure 3 A).;HR2018_58;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;This is a clear indication that during the disaster, victims had to confront a severe shortage of water along with damaged sewerage pipelines in households, which in turn restricted them to use restrooms, eventually forcing them for infrequent urination.;HR2018_59;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Therefore, presumably, infrequent urination may have enhanced urine protein concentration in victims thus increasing their health risk by significant fold (Table 5 & Figure 3B) during and following the disaster.;HR2018_60;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;We speculated that since renal anomalies/failure may be indicative of high protein level [17, 18, 19], we therefore compared the values of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and Creatinine for both pre and disaster-hit years.;HR2018_61;Method

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;As shown in Table 1, most of the clinical variates had an insignificant change in victims after the catastrophe.;HR2018_76;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;However, RBC, Hct, MCV, MCH and MCHC, Albumin, Uric acid, and importantly urine protein demonstrated a significant change.;HR2018_77;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;The results thus clearly imply, the heavy rains brought about serious deterioration of health in victims.;HR2018_78;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Of all the clinical factors that have shown significant changes, there was a sharp rise in urinary protein levels in victims soon after the disaster.;HR2018_79;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;We found that there were remarkably higher levels (levels ranging from 3-4) of urine protein in same individuals in the disaster-hit year, who otherwise had normal urine levels a year before the disaster (Levels ranging from 0-2).;HR2018_80;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;We further surged to identify the rationale for such high levels of urinary proteins in victims.;HR2018_81;Objective
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;In general physiological considerations, dehydration causes a significant increase in urinary protein levels [26, 27].;HR2018_82;Background
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Given that water outage is usual to any natural disasters, the victims generally suffer from dehydration due to a crisis of drinking water.;HR2018_83;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;It was therefore assumed that dehydration would have probably led to higher urine protein concentrations in the victims in the present study too.;HR2018_84;Background
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Interestingly, if dehydration, would have been the plausible rationale for higher urine protein as anticipated, the effect of dehydration should have also caused a decline in the levels of RBC, HCT, Hb, MCV, MCH, and MCHC.;HR2018_85;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Contrastingly, these aforementioned levels significantly enhanced in victims for disaster-hit year (the reason for which remains elusive).;HR2018_86;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Therefore, the above results suggesting dehydration as a sole confounding factor for enhanced urine protein levels cannot be justified in the present study.;HR2018_87;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;The most prominent physiological elucidation for high urine protein levels can indicate infrequent urination.;HR2018_88;Background

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;This extremely long span of water crisis forced people to refrain from using restrooms or exercising other sanitary activities.;HR2018_92;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Moreover, victims solely depended on the drinking water and preserved it by evading the use of toilets.;HR2018_93;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Adding to the difficulty, the sewerage pipelines were extensively damaged during the disaster, which further made victims avoid restrooms.;HR2018_94;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;This two weeks of troublesome living of victims by avoiding restroom well indicates infrequent urination, which further justifies their increased urine concertation of protein. Furthermore, as suggested by previous studies, infrequent urination has also been attributed to enhanced uric protein levels in patients [28, 29, 30], a similar observation can be noticed in the present study too.;HR2018_95;Results

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Therefore, from the present study, we state that although dehydration may not be associated to an increase in the urine concentration, the infrequent urination during the water outage may form a strong confounding factor for increased urine protein levels in victims following the disaster.;HR2018_96;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;In addition, dehydration not forming the main confounder for elevated urine concentrations can be attributed to the fact that, municipal corporations of Onomichi and Fukuyama City aided by Japan Self Defence forces ensured to provide safe drinking water which was delivered through an articulated water tanker in each area.;HR2018_97;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Victims in fact, solely depended on the drinking water and preserved it by evading the use of toilets.;HR2018_98;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Although there was an acute water outage in the households (due to damaged pipelines), which restricted residents to carry out any water-related chores (use of restrooms, washing etc), the drinking water was however available.;HR2018_99;Impact
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;In addition, since the clean drinking water was available for victims, it further rules out the possibility of waterborne illnesses like gastroenteritis to have increased urine protein concentration.;HR2018_100;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;This observation further supports the fact that, infrequent urination may be the most important factor for elevated protein levels in victims.;HR2018_101;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;It may well be thought that there may be a gradual decrease in the urine protein levels (caused by infrequent urination) after the water outage period and would only be irreversible unless any medical condition associated with it.;HR2018_102;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;In addition, and for the fact that, in the disaster-hit year in 2018, the annual health screening was conducted for 1.5 months, the individuals screened after the 1st week of disaster can be expected to have higher urine protein concentration than those screened at the 8th week following the disaster.;HR2018_103;Recommendation
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;However, we did not find any significant change in the mean urine protein level in a group of individuals who visited at the later weeks of disaster compared to the first week (Supplementary information S1 Tables 3 and 4).;HR2018_104;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;This observation indicates that the urine protein concentration was not much affected in individuals within 1.5 months of the disaster.;HR2018_105;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Therefore, what may be possibly assumed that the urine protein level to regress to normal levels considerably takes more time, which may be above 1.5–2 months.;HR2018_106;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Therefore, in order to understand whether urine protein levels decreased (in the absence of medical condition), a gap of 1 year may be more appropriate.;HR2018_107;Recommendation
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;To pursue this, we analyze how urine protein levels changed in individuals soon after the disaster i.e. by comparing the levels between 2017 to 2018 and a year after the disaster i.e. 2019.;HR2018_108;Method
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;A keen perusal on the comparison showed that the urine protein levels were elevated in 39 % of the individuals soon after the disaster (2018), however, elevated levels were observed in only 14.8 % of the individuals a year after the disaster (2019) (Supplementary information S1 Table 5 & Figure 1).;HR2018_109;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Further, most of the victims who otherwise showed higher urine protein levels soon after the disaster in 2018, had almost normal levels of urine protein in 2019, which indicates that they have recovered from higher urine protein levels in the span of 1 year (Supplementary information S1 Table 6).;HR2018_110;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Interestingly, when urine protein levels were compared between 2017 and 2019 (i.e a year before the disaster and a year after the disaster), the difference of mean urine protein is insignificant which is in contrast to a significant increase in urine protein upon comparison to 2017 to 2018 (Supplementary information S1 Table 7 & Figure 2).;HR2018_111;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;"Hence, this indicates that; had individuals suffered from chronic illness and systemic diseases (although we have not registered such cases for the study), there would not have been a decrease in the urine protein levels a year after the disaster, but in contrast in the present scenario, a significant decline in the urine protein levels can be observed.";HR2018_112;Results
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Therefore, these observations indicate that the observed increase in urine protein is not pathological instead is disaster-induced.;HR2018_113;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Most of the disaster influenced health studies adopts a retrospective approach wherein the health effects of the victims are analysed following the aftermaths of the disaster [31, 32, 33, 34, 35].;HR2018_114;PriorWork

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;This approach helps one to understand the magnitude to which the health deteriorated particularly attributing to the disaster thereby excluding other probable causes.;HR2018_116;Objective
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;In addition, there is limited empirical evidence to show the consequence of water outage on the health condition in disaster-affected victims, while, the present study, has attempted to rationally address the significant impact of water outage leading to potential health problems like the case of increase in the urine protein. To summon, the purpose of the present study is to convey the perils that people of Innoshima sustained during the disaster particularly in the period of water outage.;HR2018_117;Objective

HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;The increase in urine protein concentration in otherwise healthy individuals due to water outage during the disaster, is indeed a serious issue which needs to be meticulously addressed, because the findings of the present study may hold relevant to future disasters as well.;HR2018_121;Conclusion
HR2018;Impact of heavy rains of 2018 in western Japan: disaster-induced health outcomes among the population of Innoshima Island;Hence, it becomes indispensable to establish a combined strategy by concerted efforts of disaster management agencies, aftercare health services, and policymakers to address these issues and help in improving the resilience of people to cope with disasters in future.;HR2018_122;Recommendation

EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Categorised as a natural “hazard” by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), droughts are technically defined as a period of lower than average precipitation failing to meet human and environmental hydrological demands (WMO, 2008).;EDMWQ_3;HazardDescription
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Within the sphere of emerging climatic hazards, droughts are frequently considered the least understood, being classified as complex, cumulative, slow onset (i.e., creeping), persistent, and regionally extensive (Pulwarty and Sivakumar, 2014).;EDMWQ_4;Background
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Depending on their duration, severity and impact, droughts may be classified into four types, namely, meteorological, hydrological, agricultural, and socio-economic (van Loon, 2015).;EDMWQ_5;Background
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;"Irrespective of classification, drought events serve to deplete available freshwater resources, thus altering hydrodynamic regimes in both surface water and groundwater dominated catchments, with environmental and socio-economic impacts frequently outlasting the drought period (Kayam et al., 2009; Mishra and Singh, 2010; Daneshmand et al., 2014).";EDMWQ_6;Impact

EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Moreover, periods of drought, and particularly those experienced in non-arid regions, are invariably associated with increased anthropogenic water demand in concurrence with decreased resource availability, potentially leading to over-exploitation and exacerbation of groundwater quality deterioration (Stanke et al., 2013).;EDMWQ_11;Impact
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Typically, meteorological drought conditions propagate through the hydrological cycle, with surface-water resources affected relatively rapidly, while groundwater resources are typically the last impacted hydrological component.;EDMWQ_12;HazardDescription
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;"Groundwater environments are often associated with an inherent resilience to external stimuli and the capacity to “buffer” effects of short-term climate hazards (Vaux, 2011; Sonnenborg et al., 2012).";EDMWQ_13;Background

EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;For example, O'Dwyer et al. (2018) report that intrinsic (e.g. aquifer classification, presence of karst bedrocks), specific (e.g. local livestock density, local septic tank density) and infrastructural (e.g. individual source depth and type) were concurrently predictive of source contamination (E. coli) in the southwest of Ireland over a 2-year sampling period.;EDMWQ_124;PriorWork
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Likewise, Hynds et al. (2012) report that intrinsic (e.g. bedrock type) and infrastructural (e.g. source wellhead finish, liner clearance) attributes were highly predictive (≈90%) of E. coli presence in private wells across five Irish study areas from 2008 to 2011.;EDMWQ_125;PriorWork

EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Across both sampling periods (drought and post-drought), hydrogeological factors were shown to exert negligible influence on E. coli contamination, with local subsoil type (p = 0.009) during drought conditions representing the only significant factor at a 95% confidence level, representing further evidence to the abovementioned hypothesis i.e. cessation of intrinsic and infrastructural contamination mechanisms, with localised specific mechanisms predominant in the absence of significant aquifer-specific attributes (i.e. decreased (vertical) catchment hydrological connectivity).;EDMWQ_127;Results

EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Considering the concurrent soil moisture deficit during the 2018 drought in concurrence with the reported environmental survival of E. coli (6–10 weeks), the presence of E. coli in groundwater supplies overlain by Lower Palaeozoic sandstone tills, which have a relatively high permeability, may be indicative of ‘legacy’ contamination events, thus supporting the hypothesis that E. coli naturalisation within groundwater may have occurred, as reported elsewhere (Filip and Demnerova, 2009).;EDMWQ_135;Results
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Thus, the presence of E. coli during drought conditions may be indicative of E. coli naturalisation (i.e. environmental adaptation) within select Irish groundwater supplies or during specific climactic periods.;EDMWQ_136;Results
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;This potentially important finding requires further investigation as the apparent survival and adaptation of E. coli within groundwater would invalidate the use of E. coli as a faecal indicator bacterial species (Hagedorn et al., 2011).;EDMWQ_137;Recommendation

EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;In light of the significantly reduced level of subsurface transport during the sampled drought event (i.e., recharge/infiltration), it is tentatively hypothesised that E. coli contamination identified during summer 2018 represents a significant hydrodynamic shirt whereby localised “specific” contamination mechanisms predominate, with a partial or total cessation of intrinsic and infrastructural mechanisms.;EDMWQ_140;Results
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Moreover, findings that ‘legacy’ contamination events i.e., faecal materials deposited in sub-surface prior to drought onset, are likely the primary source of E. coli in sampled groundwater sources, thus pointing to potential naturalisation/adaptation of E. coli within (vulnerable) groundwater systems overlain by high permeability tills.;EDMWQ_141;Results
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;Given the increased threat of drought conditions in temperate maritime regions under expected climate change scenarios, the current study shines a light on the potential challenges facing groundwater users, while reiterating the persistent issue of microbial contamination of domestic drinking water wells in the ROI.;EDMWQ_142;Conclusion
EDMWQ;Impact of the 2018 European drought on microbial groundwater quality in private domestic wells: A case study from a temperate maritime climate;With available groundwater contamination data generally restricted to expected seasonal cycles (i.e., current information on groundwater microbial contamination during drought events is extremely limited), the evidence presented provides key insights into the influence of drought on microbial contamination of private groundwater supplies.;EDMWQ_143;Conclusion

DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;From national crop data time series, we extract seven year windows centred on years in which an EWD occurred, with three years preceding and following the event.;DHC50Y_34;Method
DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;If an EWD of the same type occurred in a subsequent year, we average the data across all years with successive EWD occurrence (e.g. multi-year drought) to produce a single disaster year datum, which is then surrounded by the six adjacent years.;DHC50Y_35;Method
DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;This procedure results in a reduction in the total number of events since the average of sequential EWD years of same type is considered as one event.;DHC50Y_36;Method

DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;Even though there are limitations linked to the use of disaster events as a metric for analysing extreme weather responses, it provides an alternative, impact-based approach that helps reveal important new information regarding the trend of EWD impacts in the agriculture sector.;DHC50Y_133;Discussion
DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;European crop yields increased by 146% over the past 50 years (107% in cereal yields) (FAO 2019a), which does not affect the calculation of EWD impacts as the SEA approach removed such management trends.;DHC50Y_134;Background
DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;However, higher-yielding systems are often associated with larger yield variability (e.g. Müller et al (2018)), which can be a contributing factor to increased EWD impacts in recent decades.;DHC50Y_135;Background
DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;While the number of drought-related disasters is lower than other EWD types resulting in lower statistical significance levels for drought impacts, consistent pattern in the observational data suggest that drought-related cereal production losses have seen sharp increases, with additional 3% losses per year.;DHC50Y_136;Discussion

DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;The increase in event frequency may partially be explained by the increased exposure and vulnerability of the affected systems, and by better recording and reporting, yet much of the increase has been attributed to a significant rise in the number of climate change-related extreme weather events (UNDRR/CRED 2020).;DHC50Y_151;Discussion
DHC50Y;Severity of drought and heatwave crop losses tripled over the last five decades in Europe;The severity of individual events, however, is expected to be largely independent from reporting biases (yet a more frequent reporting bias can result in reporting less severe climatological events, which is not in line with our findings showing consistently more severe impacts in recent decades).;DHC50Y_152;Discussion

Climatological threshold-based approaches (e.g. Lobell et al (2013), Lüttger and Feike (2018), Vogel et al (2019)) may underestimate impacts of EWDs in the agriculture sector, because similar weather anomalies result in differing effects depending on the vulnerability of the exposed system (Lesk et al 2016).;DHC50Y_156;Discussion

PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Recent studies in human beings have also provided evidence that ambient and indoor pollutants could cross the placenta and damage the fetal brain, probably by inducing inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular injury.12,  13,  14,  15;PSDBCC_149;PriorWork

PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Because the incidence and intensity of sand and dust storms varies greatly by year and season and is hard to predict beforehand, people cannot choose which years to be pregnant in to avoid them.;PSDBCC_152;Background
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;On the basis of this feature, we adopted a region-and-year fixed-effect model to compare children who were in the prenatal period in the same region and year, but with varying incidence of prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms.;PSDBCC_153;Method
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;In this way, we could effectively remove the effect of unobservable region-specific and year-specific variables that do not vary over time.;PSDBCC_154;Method
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;The records on each child's gestational time and birth date further allowed us to identify the amount of exposure to sand and dust storms in each gestational month and look into the effects of this exposure by gestational month.;PSDBCC_155;Method

PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;This study has several limitations.;PSDBCC_157;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;First, we cannot fully exclude the effects of other pollutants, such as NO2, SO2, and O3 because we did not have sufficient data.;PSDBCC_158;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Although we did a sensitivity analysis by including annual average levels of SO2 and NO2 since 2003 in the regression, we acknowledge that the annual data do not capture seasonal variations in SO2 and NO2.;PSDBCC_159;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;However, many studies have reported that levels of these pollutants are highest in winter months and have only minor annual fluctuations, which supports our assumption that the occurrence of sand and dust storms is not correlated with levels of other pollutants.33;PSDBCC_160;Discussion
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Moreover, by controlling for the child's birth month, we are comparing the effects of prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms among children born in the same month with similar exposure to other pollutants.;PSDBCC_161;Method
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Second, the data on the age at which children began speaking in sentences and counting from one to ten might be affected by recall bias.;PSDBCC_162;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;To address this issue, when the children were surveyed repeatedly with these questions in different survey rounds, we used the answers from the first survey.;PSDBCC_163;Method
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;We also conducted a sensitivity analysis that included age-fixed effects to study the association between sand and dust storms and cognitive outcomes among children who were the same age when the survey was administered and born in the same region and year. Results were similar to those in the main model.;PSDBCC_164;Method
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Third, we cannot fully exclude the effects of indoor pollutants, nor can we control for the pregnant women's behavioural patterns during sand and dust storms.;PSDBCC_165;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;For example, if women were more likely to stay indoors during sand and dust storms, they might be less exposed to sand and dust storms but more exposed to indoor pollutants, causing the estimations to change in an unknown direction.;PSDBCC_166;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;To control for the potential effects of indoor pollutants, we included the types of cooking fuels in the analysis.;PSDBCC_167;Method
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;We compared the results from regressions with and without the variable for cooking fuel (appendix) and found that the coefficient on sand and dust storm exposure was essentially unchanged across the two specifications and the coefficients for cooking fuel were not significant.;PSDBCC_168;Results

PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;The coefficients for the interaction terms were not significant, suggesting that the associations between in-utero exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function did not differ significantly with the types of cooking fuel used in the household.;PSDBCC_170;Results
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;However, this method suffered from the fact that CFPS only reported the types of cooking fuel used at the time the surveys were administered, which could differ from the type of cooking fuel used during the woman's pregnancy, and the types of cooking fuels cannot fully represent the effects of all indoor pollutants.;PSDBCC_171;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Fourth, we cannot account for stillbirths or infant or child deaths in our study.;PSDBCC_172;Recommendation

PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Pregnant mothers might choose to temporarily move out from their usual home to avoid exposure to sand and dust storms and move back in after it was over. This migration might not be random and could systematically affect our results in an unknown direction.;PSDBCC_176;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Sixth, we cannot tell whether the effects of sand and dust storms are generalisable to children outside of our sample (ie, those not meeting the exclusion criteria).;PSDBCC_177;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Seventh, we cannot test the mechanisms by which pollutants might affect children's cognitive function.;PSDBCC_178;Recommendation
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Although previous studies in animals or human beings have provided some evidence that the inhalation of air pollutants during pregnancy affects the development of the fetal CNS, none of the studies focused specifically on sand and dust storms.;PSDBCC_179;PriorWork
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Finally, the strong winds and the dry soil surfaces, the two necessary conditions for the occurrence of sand and dust storms, might affect maternal and child health through other channels, such as reducing food productivity, triggering infectious diseases, or affecting electricity and water supply.;PSDBCC_180;CascadingHazard

PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms on children's cognitive function.;PSDBCC_181;Conclusion
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Our results suggest that in-utero exposure to sand and dust storms could have long-lasting adverse effects on children's cognitive development, particularly when exposure occurred during the sixth and seventh gestational months.;PSDBCC_182;Conclusion
PSDBCC;Prenatal exposure to sand and dust storms and children's cognitive function in China: a quasi-experimental study;Although this study could provide strong causal inference, more research is needed to replicate these results and identify the short-term and long-term effects of in-utero exposure to sand and dust storms on children's health.;PSDBCC_183;Recommendation

AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;This suggests that the main health impact seen in EDs associated with the 2013 Ice Storm was an increase in visits for injuries, whereas the other increases were more likely due to general severe winter weather experienced in Ontario at that time.;AFL2013_92;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;The decision to focus on cardiac events, injuries and environmental causes of illness was based on our literature review on the potential excesses of acute health impacts of ice storms [9–11].;AFL2013_93;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;We did not examine injury data by injury site because of the low number of events in each category.;AFL2013_94;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;Other studies that have examined acute injury data identified a variety of injury types such as falls [5, 6], soft tissue injuries and fractures [7, 8, 11], motor vehicle injuries [13] and injuries related to the recovery process and clean-up [5, 6, 13].;AFL2013_95;PriorWork

AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;While we expected rates of cardiac events to rise related to strenuous physical activity and emotional stress, it is possible that at-risk individuals avoided precipitating activities because of the severity of the weather system and its aftermath or for other reasons.;AFL2013_99;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;With regard to environmental causes of illness, cases of CO poisoning are often cited as one of the most notable findings associated with ice storms as a result of power failures that occur which may prompt the use of other temporary heat sources.;AFL2013_100;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;In fact, some ice storm studies have focused exclusively on this outcome [15–18, 24].;AFL2013_101;PriorWork
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;For this study, the rarity of cases occurring in periods other than the 2013 Ice Storm (i.e., zero cases in most years) prevented the appropriate use of Poisson models to generate comparative statistics.;AFL2013_102;Recommendation

AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;First, it employs the use of population-level data, which appears to have only been employed in one other study describing an ice storm in Oklahoma in 2007 [13].;AFL2013_110;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;However, the Oklahoma study was limited to assessment of mandatory data reports that were reported solely for the purposes of tracking information during the storm itself, and thus no control was captured for comparison.;AFL2013_111;Discussion
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;The LCDC Study [11] compared findings from the 1998 ice storm in Eastern Ontario with comparable periods in the preceding year, but this data was gathered through chart review data from five eastern Ontario hospitals over a four-week period comparing the 1998 storm year and the previous year.;AFL2013_112;PriorWork
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;The use of data gleaned from chart reviews is a reasonable approach but is limited by chart selection as well as questions about the rigour and consistency of data extraction methods.;AFL2013_113;Recommendation
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;"By comparison, our study made use of NACRS, an existing robust administrative population-based database; as such, the data were not opportunistically gathered for the purposes of this study, but rather were collected contemporaneously, cleaned and maintained.";AFL2013_114;Method

AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;Second, as the data represented counts occurring during specific periods of time, the use of Poisson regression was an improvement upon previous analyses of ice storm impacts, as other studies often provided only descriptive statistics or very basic comparisons with control periods.;AFL2013_116;Method

AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;This study made use of both diagnostic codes and codes that specify external causes using ICD nomenclature and coding.;AFL2013_119;Method
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;The accuracy of the data captured by NACRS is reflective of how care providers and hospital coders identified both accurate diagnoses and external causes of relevance (e.g. cold exposures, CO exposures).;AFL2013_120;Method
AFL2013;Assessing health impacts of the December 2013 Ice storm in Ontario, Canada;Since the dataset used in this study was of sufficient size and represented the entire City of Toronto and City of Ottawa, and since the NACRS database is considered to be high quality [30], it is unlikely that inaccurate coding would have had a significant effect on the results produced.;AFL2013_121;Recommendation

DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Drought and bark beetle outbreaks that result in tree mortality are natural disturbance processes in the mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada [17].;DMSNTC_15;Background
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;However, human activities (e.g., fire exclusion, historic logging) have greatly altered these communities, resulting in changes to forest composition and structure, including a higher representation of fire-sensitive and shade-tolerant species (e.g., Calocedrus decurrens (Torr.) Florin and Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl. Ex Hildebr., higher stand densities, and increased stand homogenization [18,19].;DMSNTC_16;Background

DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;"For example, tree size is often correlated with drought induced mortality, and large trees are consistently cited as more prone to mortality during drought across a wide range of forest types and topographic conditions [21], in part owing to the tendency of bark beetles (such as western pine beetle, Denroctonous brevicomis; or mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae) to target larger diameter pines [22,23].";DMSNTC_18;Background

DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Across species, a positive relationship between tree size and survival was consistent among our study species.;DMSNTC_127;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Guarín and Taylor [30] reported that across sites tree mortality was greater for small and intermediate size classes (5 to 45.7 cm DBH) than for large (> 45.7 cm DBH) trees, except for P. ponderosa.;DMSNTC_128;PriorWork
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Similarly, in terms of TPH, trees from smaller diameter classes, were disproportionally impacted throughout the mortality event and as tree size increased, survivorship also increased.;DMSNTC_129;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Interestingly, other studies from the region report that stands with a greater mean diameter of P. ponderosa and P. lambertiana experienced greater levels of tree mortality than stands with smaller diameter pines [25], suggesting that tree morality patterns may be scale-dependent.;DMSNTC_130;PriorWork
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Further, since we were able to track mortality annually with individual tree data, the factors related to individual survivorship year to year may be different from those including all mortality across years [31].;DMSNTC_131;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Being tall was more consistently associated with survivorship than larger tree diameter across species.;DMSNTC_132;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;"In Mediterranean climates, ontogenetic life stage may determine susceptibility of mortality from drought; larger trees were less prone to drought-related death while seedlings experienced greater mortality [21,32,33].";DMSNTC_133;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;In addition, greater mortality of smaller diameter C. decurrens following the drought may be attributed to lower drought tolerance in small-diameter stems, possibly due to sunscald of this shade-tolerant species following overstory canopy mortality [34], or increased activity of cedar bark beetles (Phloeosinus spp.) that appeared to target smaller stems as their numbers increased with progressing drought.;DMSNTC_134;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Both pine species were dramatically impacted during the short timeframe from May to August 2015, continuing into 2016, whereas A. concolor and C. decurrens mortality occurred later.;DMSNTC_135;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Both pine species were dramatically impacted during the short timeframe from May to August 2015, continuing into 2016, whereas A. concolor and C. decurrens mortality occurred later.;DMSNTC_136;Impact
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Although both species are considered drought intolerant in comparison to P. lambertiana and P. ponderosa [35], bark beetles likely were the major contributor to the rapid initial mortality in both pine species especially in the medium to large (≥ 25 cm DBH) size classes [36].;DMSNTC_137;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;This shift in tree species composition impacted by insects is consistent from previous intensive droughts [37,38], and the proportion of pine stocking was most influential on P. ponderosa survival in our study.;DMSNTC_138;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;High densities of host tree species are associated with high levels of mortality from insect outbreaks.;DMSNTC_139;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;This is due to increased intraspecific competition and greater available breeding space and habitat for tree insects.;DMSNTC_140;Background
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;The reduced pine mortality on sites with increased BA in our study could be attributed to more productive sites supporting greater BA and increased species diversity.;DMSNTC_141;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Especially in higher-elevation, mixed conifer stands, increased buffering from moisture stress on productive sites and lower host densities may help to reduce drought effects and pine mortality.;DMSNTC_142;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Climate change is also expected to affect bark beetle outbreaks with warmer winter weather associated with higher populations [22] and increased climatic water deficit may result in reduced defense mechanisms to bark beetle attack [39,40].;DMSNTC_143;Background
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Zhang et al. [41] reported that stands exceeding a stand density index (SDI) of 202 (or approximately 12.1 m2 of basal area) experienced significant bark beetle mortality.;DMSNTC_144;PriorWork
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Preisler et al. [42] suggest that due to the extreme drought, a higher proportion of mortality is likely driven by drought than bark beetles alone, but areas affected by mortality prior to the drought (‘beetle pressure’) were highly correlated to subsequent mortality in neighboring areas.;DMSNTC_145;PriorWork
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Using the resilience approach suggested by Millar et al. [43] and Scott et al. [44], which includes promoting patterns of high structural and compositional spatial heterogeneity [45], the results of our study can help guide forest management in drought-prone forest ecosystems.;DMSNTC_146;PriorWork
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;First, larger trees had higher initial survivorship, so stand density management prior to the onset of the drought that accelerates large tree height and diameter growth may increase stand resistance to future droughts and moisture stress.;DMSNTC_147;Results
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;This would require sufficient reductions in stand densities to levels within the natural range of variation [19] to reduce the risk of compounding disturbance on P. ponderosa and P. lambertiana [25].;DMSNTC_148;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Second, promoting mixed species stands to reduce host density and increase stand and landscape heterogeneity could further increase stand resistance and resilience to future droughts and insect attacks, especially in stands dominated by P. ponderosa.;DMSNTC_149;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;In addition, drought-tolerant Quercus species may have a greater role in the resilience of mixed conifer forests.;DMSNTC_150;Discussion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Further, reforestation and thinning treatments may need to be altered and locations planned based on abiotic conditions.;DMSNTC_151;Recommendation
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Lastly, as the frequency and duration of drought events are expected to increase with climate warming, approaches to forest management will need to adapt to changing ecological conditions.;DMSNTC_152;Recommendation

DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;In our study, tree species, such as P. ponderosa, were severely impacted by the compounding disturbances of drought and bark beetle outbreaks.;DMSNTC_155;Conclusion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;However, the surviving P. ponderosa overstory trees may also have drought-tolerance traits that could be important for recruitment.;DMSNTC_156;Conclusion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Increased overstory basal area and the proportion of pine stocking were also indicative of higher mortality, especially for pine species.;DMSNTC_157;Conclusion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Prioritizing reductions in stand density prior to drought may help to alleviate individual tree stress.;DMSNTC_158;Conclusion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Additionally, tree diversity at the stand level may reduce the impact of bark beetles on pine species by reducing the proximity of available host species.;DMSNTC_159;Conclusion
DMSNTC;Drought Impacts and Compounding Mortality on Forest Trees in the Southern Sierra Nevada;Management to promote more heterogeneous stand structures and composition, including reducing the proportion of basal area occupied by pine, may provide increased resilience to drought and related stressors.;DMSNTC_160;Conclusion
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Introduction;MPCCCL_1;PaperSection
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Drought is a complex, natural hazard, with an onset that is often slow and difficult to detect, but with effects that can last for a long period of time and damage that can be widespread, resulting in significant economic losses, particularly in agriculture.;MPCCCL_2;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;While extended dry spells are often caused by natural climate variability, their intensity and frequency has increased in the past decades [1].;MPCCCL_3;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;This trend is expected to continue during the 21st century as a result of climate change [2,3].;MPCCCL_4;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Droughts are affecting more people than any other socio-natural hazard in the world [4], and although in many cases the consequences of drought can be well predicted, preventive strategies are frequently insufficient to avoid serious impacts [5].;MPCCCL_5;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Failure to adapt to drought, especially in the context of a changing climate, causes and will continue to cause serious financial impacts for farmers, reducing employment in rural areas, affecting food availability and prices, driving a significant number of people into poverty, and triggering migration from rural to urban areas [6,7].;MPCCCL_6;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The study of public perception of drought can contribute to the successful implementation of drought adaptation strategies.;MPCCCL_7;Motivation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;An understanding of the public’s sensitivity to and conceptualization of droughts and their effects, as well as public perception of the way droughts relate to climate change, has the potential to support the definition of what can be done, who is going to do it, who will benefit from this action, and how it will be evaluated [8,9,10].;MPCCCL_8;Motivation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Duinen, et al. ([8], p. 1082) describes two types of adaptation: private and public.;MPCCCL_9;PriorWork
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Private adaptation is defined as individuals’ behavioural responses to drought for the sake of private benefit, as defined by Duinen, et al. [8] who emphasize that private adaptation ‘plays an important role in reducing vulnerability and enhances the performance of the agricultural sector as a whole’.;MPCCCL_10;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Public adaptation includes the adaptive responses that are developed by governments that are ‘often required to reinforce private initiatives and may include the provision of financial incentives, the removal of institutional barriers or the creation of awareness’ [8].;MPCCCL_11;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Given the intimate relationship between public and private adaptation, in order to develop well-targeted public policies, further research is required to understand public perception and adaptation behaviour while recognizing current actions, willingness to incorporate new actions, barriers to behavioural changes, and ways to overcome these barriers and reinforce adaptive capacity [11,12,13].;MPCCCL_12;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;A series of studies aiming to understand the factors that drive individuals to take actions to adapt to drought have concluded that people who perceive drought as a potential risk are more likely to incorporate adaptation strategies than those who do not [8,14,15,16].;MPCCCL_13;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Additionally, literature indicates that socioeconomic characteristics and resource constraints are the major determinants of drought adaptation, and that a shared understanding of drought allows public and private stakeholders to coordinate actions to cope with drought impacts [8,17,18,19].;MPCCCL_14;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Since 2010, an uninterrupted sequence of dry years, with annual rainfall deficits from 25 to 45 per cent has affected central Chile (30–38 °S) [20].;MPCCCL_15;HazardDescription
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Given its unprecedented duration and large spatial extent, this phenomenon is referred to as the Central Chile Mega-drought.;MPCCCL_16;HazardDescription
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The Mega-drought has concurred with the warmest decade on record for central Chile [21], a factor that has increased the drought’s severity by increasing reservoir evaporation [20].;MPCCCL_17;HazardDescription
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Boisier et al. [22] concluded that a quarter of this rainfall deficit is caused by climate change, prompting a reflection that the hydrological reality of Chile is moving toward more frequent and severe droughts [23,24].;MPCCCL_18;HazardCause

MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;There is therefore a call for authorities and communities in Chile to reinforce their actions in order to adapt to this new reality.;MPCCCL_20;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Central Chile concentrates 81.2 per cent of the country’s population [25], and most of the agricultural production.;MPCCCL_21;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The region has a Mediterranean-like climate with precipitation concentrated in winter: April to September [26].;MPCCCL_22;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Irrigation demands for agriculture during spring and summer are supplied by snow-melt river flow, water reservoirs, and groundwater [27].;MPCCCL_23;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;"Over 90 per cent of the human water demand in Chile is met by drinking water companies; these companies also use groundwater or snow and water reservoirs, with desalination not representing an important water source.";MPCCCL_24;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Given this scenario, any reduction of rainfall constitutes a stressor for the system [24].;MPCCCL_25;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The Chilean government has made significant advances in terms of climate change and drought adaptation policies and policy instruments over the last decade [28].;MPCCCL_26;Response
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Nevertheless, research on climate change and drought perception has not informed climate change policy, with few studies focusing on this issue [29,30,31,32,33].;MPCCCL_27;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;This situation reveals not only a relevant gap in literature, but also a deficient bottom-up approach to public policy development.;MPCCCL_28;Motivation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Results of the few existing studies show, for example, that changes in climate have been recognized by a majority of individuals, with signs such as a reduction of rain frequency and quantity being most frequently mentioned.;MPCCCL_29;PriorWork
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;In the context of a dryer and warmer future climate scenario, understanding how different actors perceive drought and drought impacts is relevant to informing policy and decision-making.;MPCCCL_30;Motivation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The recent protracted, extended central Chile Mega-drought, with a quarter of rainfall deficit attributed to climate change, offers a synopsis of the future and thus a novel opportunity to study drought perception in the context of a changing climate.;MPCCCL_31;Motivation

MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The study results of the recognition of more intense water demand for human use as the main cause of drought concurs with relevant literature [5,11,31,33,40], where climate change and natural variability are identified as secondary causes.;MPCCCL_187;Results
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;This suggests that drought is mainly framed as a management issue and that, as many other studies point out, the existing water management model should be reviewed [41,42,43].;MPCCCL_188;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The Water Code (The Chilean Water Code was introduced in 1981 and later amended in 2005.;MPCCCL_189;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Its most important feature is the introduction of Water Use Rights (WUR), aiming to favor the establishment of a water market.;MPCCCL_190;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;These WUR are independent from land ownership, they are granted for life and can be freely and unrestrictedly traded as any other real estate.) in Chile allows the private use of water through the assignation of ‘water rights’, leaving water use (efficient or otherwise) to be determined by trading on the water market.;MPCCCL_191;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Due to the lack of accurate hydrological information when the code came into effect, most of the water basins in Chile were overexploited (with more water rights assigned than water available), and the Water Code does not present efficient ways to regulate or prevent conflicts resulting from water scarcity—a situation that faces even more pressure in the face of drought and climate change.;MPCCCL_192;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Regarding climate change and its connection to drought, the literature suggests that even though people recognize many climate-related problems, these are not always linked specifically to climate change [31,33].;MPCCCL_193;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Despite Boisier et al. [22] study, assigning 25 per cent of the Mega-drought to climate change, this understanding is not easy to transfer to a non-scientific community, especially when droughts are a normal or known climatic condition in a given territory.;MPCCCL_194;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Policy makers must therefore take responsibility for understanding and addressing the ways climate change will alter drought frequency and intensity.;MPCCCL_195;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The few interviewees who recognized climate change as a cause of drought were mainly between the ages of 35 and 55 and came from an urban context.;MPCCCL_196;Results

MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;As presented by Habiba et al.

MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;The vulnerability of human and social systems is exacerbated by drought conditions, and it is essential to develop adaptation actions with attention to social capital, trust, and social participation that support social cohesion.;MPCCCL_210;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;With regard to productive sectors, the results of our study are similar to those presented by Ogalleh et al. [6], Olmos-Martínez et al. [9], and Udmale et al. [7], with drought impacts focused mainly on agriculture and, to a lesser extent, other economic activities such as tourism.;MPCCCL_211;PriorWork
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;As is widely presented in the literature, the impacts of droughts on agriculture experienced around the world [5,6,7,9,13,40], and in Chile in particular [31,32,33,48,49], are more or less similar, recurrent, and well understood—and, therefore, are relatively easy to predict.;MPCCCL_212;Background
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;That is why preventive actions and actions to reduce vulnerability in the early stages of drought can and should be taken, such as the promotion of water efficient agricultural practices or the adaptation of new technologies.;MPCCCL_213;Recommendation
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;Regarding tourism, one impact that is mentioned was an increase in costs for operators—for example, the cost of generating artificial snow for ski centres.;MPCCCL_214;Impact
MPCCCL;Local Perception of Drought Impacts in a Changing Climate: The Mega-Drought in Central Chile;This example reflects the low degree of preparation and adaptation to the new climatic conditions of the territory as an action that, as described by [46], does require cultural change and cannot be considered a “sustainable adaptation”.;MPCCCL_215;Results

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The exposure of tourism to natural disasters may be linked to the attractiveness of many high-risk exotic locations, where natural disasters such as hurricanes, avalanches, and volcanic activity are likely to occur (Murphy and Bayley, 1989).;HSCTCA_41;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;"Natural disasters pose significant physical damage to infrastructure including airports, sea ports, roads, hotels, attractions, and environmental amenities, which reduces the country’s ability to cater to tourist needs and its attractiveness, at least in the short term (Ghobarah et al., 2006; Parajuli and Haynes 2016).";HSCTCA_42;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Psychological factors and persons’ risk perceptions associated with media coverage that show loss of life and human suffering and economic and social disruption can also spur negative publicity about a destination and reduce arrivals until pre-disaster conditions resume (Sonmez et al., 1999).;HSCTCA_43;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Travelers may also choose not to visit a disaster struck destination because of ethical concerns as they feel that they may obstruct the recovery effort and place an additional burden on the country’s resources and infrastructure (Becken et al., 2015).;HSCTCA_44;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;"The risk of a natural disaster occurrence without its actual occurrence can also reduce visitor arrivals since travel plans are made by taking potential risks into account (Becken et al., 2015; Park and Reisinger, 2008).";HSCTCA_45;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;"Additionally, tourists may avoid a disaster prone area since they are unfamiliar with the destination and its natural forces and are therefore more easily exposed to the threat of natural disasters (Drabek, 1995; Rittichainuwat, 2006).";HSCTCA_46;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The amount of risks an international traveler is willing to take is also influenced by their cultural, demographic, and economic background, where low income tourists are more concerned about natural disasters because they have less money and therefore avoid making risky travel plans (Park and Reisinger, 2010).;HSCTCA_47;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Among the handful of empirical studies, the evidence demonstrates that natural disasters pose a threat to international tourist arrivals.;HSCTCA_48;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Rossello et al. (2020) investigated natural and man-made disasters using a gravity model, for international tourism flows to quantify the effects of different types of natural and man-made disasters on tourist arrivals to the affected countries.;HSCTCA_49;PriorWork
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;They provided evidence that the occurrence of different types of disaster events change international tourist inflows differently where natural disasters more negatively affect arrivals.;HSCTCA_50;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Ma et al. (2020) also examined natural and man-made events looking at earthquakes and terrorist attacks.;HSCTCA_51;PriorWork
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;They adopted a difference-in-difference research method and online review data from TripAdvisor to comparatively analyze the effects of catastrophic events with varying natures, frequencies, and intensities on tourism.;HSCTCA_52;PriorWork
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The results show that earthquakes had a greater effect on reducing the number of visitors.;HSCTCA_53;PriorWork
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;In a study of hurricanes across Caribbean countries, Granvorka and Strobl (2013) derived a hurricane destruction index based on wind speed to estimate the impact of hurricanes and concluded that an average hurricane strike caused total (air and cruise) arrivals to be about 2% lower than they would have been had no strike occurred.;HSCTCA_54;PriorWork
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;These studies generally consider a single type of tourist or total tourism and there is little comparison of how different categories of tourists respond to or recover from negative events, such as, for example, air versus cruise travelers (Ritchie and Jiang, 2019).;HSCTCA_55;Background

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;A tropical cyclone is the meteorological term for a storm system that forms in the tropics.;HSCTCA_57;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;They are referred to as hurricanes if they are formed in the North Atlantic and are of sufficient strength measured by wind speed, generally at least 119 km/h.;HSCTCA_58;HazardDescription
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Hurricanes in the Caribbean develop from a low pressure system generally off the coast of Africa from a tropical storm which, in turn, begins as a tropical depression.;HSCTCA_59;HazardCause
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The Atlantic Hurricane season generally runs from June to November, but can start as early as May.;HSCTCA_60;HazardDescription
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Hurricanes are extremely destructive.;HSCTCA_61;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Their strong winds may cause damage to agricultural crops and buildings, homes, and infrastructure.;HSCTCA_62;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;They are accompanied by heavy rainfall, which results in flooding, landslips, and landslides.;HSCTCA_63;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;They also bring with them storm surges as their high winds push on the ocean’s surface causing coastal erosion, property damage, and salt contamination.;HSCTCA_64;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The extent of potential damage caused by a hurricane depends on various factors, including where it strikes and what is located in that area, the slope of the continental shelf, and the shape of the coastline in the landfall region. Destruction is typically measured in terms of wind speed.;HSCTCA_65;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;It is generally agreed that considerable damage occurs when a hurricane reaches speeds of at least 178 km/h in approaching the coast and/or making landfall, where 178 km/h refers to level three on the widely used Saffir–Simpson tropical storm severity scale.;HSCTCA_66;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;In relation to tourist arrivals, a priori one should expect the impact of hurricanes to take place via two channels.;HSCTCA_67;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Hurricanes bring with them direct costs, such as the destruction of infrastructure, coastal degradation, and tourism amenities, which will lower the quality of the location as a tourist destination, at least in the short term.;HSCTCA_68;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The potential fall in tourist arrivals in the Caribbean after a hurricane strike is likely due to damages to infrastructure and a general increase in economic and social disruption and safety concerns which can reduce the region’s ability to accommodate tourists and its attractiveness.;HSCTCA_69;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Sealy and Strobl (2017) found expected losses from hurricanes in the Bahamas of about 2% of coastal property including hotels and other tourist accommodations and attractions, where more devastating strikes could cause up to 34% in losses.;HSCTCA_70;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;This destruction may translate into a fall in tourist arrivals.;HSCTCA_71;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Reports show that after Hurricane David in 1979, Dominica experienced a 30% decline in tourist arrivals as a consequence of destruction to infrastructure and facilities (Benson et al., 2001).;HSCTCA_72;Impact
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;More recently in 2017, Hurricane Irma sharply reduced American visitors by 79% in Sint Maarten and 45.6% in Puerto Rico compared to the previous year (CTO, 2019).;HSCTCA_73;Impact
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Hurricanes in the Caribbean therefore represent a major shock to tourism and can significantly affect visitor arrivals.;HSCTCA_74;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;On the other hand, one might anticipate hurricane strikes increasing the subjective perceived probability of future hurricanes, further discouraging tourists who are on the margins of choosing the affected country relative to alternative destinations, thereby reducing future arrivals.;HSCTCA_75;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;In relation to the Caribbean, a strong tourist economy cannot grow unless potential tourists perceive the destination as safe place to vacation.;HSCTCA_77;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;A particularly destructive hurricane that caused severe damage, loss of life, and suffering may create a lasting image that a Caribbean destination is a dangerous and risky place for vacation.;HSCTCA_78;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Forster et al. (2012) showed that in Anguilla, hurricane risk influenced the risk perceptions and decisions regarding holiday preferences by tourists, which can reduce international visitors.;HSCTCA_79;Background

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The cruise industry is the fastest growing category in the leisure travel market.;HSCTCA_81;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Since 1980 cruise tourism has become a popular alternative to air travel in the international tourism market, and has experienced an average annual passenger growth rate of approximately 7% yearly (CLIA, 2017).;HSCTCA_82;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Further, between 2005 and 2015, the demand for cruising increased by 62% (CLIA, 2017).;HSCTCA_83;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;This has been driven by targeting mass numbers, new ports-of-call and expanded itineraries, an increase in demand for all-inclusive type packages, and digitization of the tourism sector (Dowling, 2006).;HSCTCA_84;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Cruises now offer, guided tours in port cities, shore excursions in visitor centers, and sometimes even overnight stays, and may therefore also contribute to the local economy.;HSCTCA_85;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The cruise and air arrival tourism segments differ in many ways and as such the impact of hurricanes on each segment may vary as well.;HSCTCA_86;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The largest difference may be in terms of spending patterns, number of destinations, and length of stay.;HSCTCA_87;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Cruise visitors generally spend relatively less in a given location, while at the same time they visit multiple destinations for a shorter period of time compared to air arrivals (CDB, 2017).;HSCTCA_88;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Airlines and airplane passengers are significantly more flexible in terms of their flights.;HSCTCA_89;Background

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The difference in the impact of hurricanes on air versus cruise tourists is important given that the composition of cruise to air tourists has been changing in the Caribbean and their spending patterns differ significantly.;HSCTCA_99;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;"More precisely, air arrivals into the region has been growing slowly compared to cruise arrivals because of intensified competition from other destinations; over the period 1989–2014, the number of air arrivals to the region grew at an average rate of 2.5% compared to 4.5% globally, while the number of cruise arrivals more than tripled (CDB, 2017).";HSCTCA_100;Background

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;This may be due to several factors such as flexibility of air travel rescheduling, possible destination changes from cruise operators, and promotions and discounts aimed at different tourist segments.;HSCTCA_316;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The fact that different segments of tourists showed different adjustment effects points to the importance of being able to distinguish between different groups of tourists.;HSCTCA_317;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;These differences can provide an insight into how local authorities and industry leaders can approach cruise tourists and airplane tourists in the Caribbean.;HSCTCA_318;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;First, it seems as if the region’s ex post hurricane efforts at attracting airplane tourists are working.;HSCTCA_319;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Second, it shows that countries should potentially try to incentivize cruise ship companies and passengers to continue to visit at ex ante levels following a hurricane event.;HSCTCA_320;Method
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;These results are noteworthy, since the effect that natural disasters and more generally negative shocks have on different types of tourists has been sparsely studied in the literature before.;HSCTCA_321;Method
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Moreover, the literature suggests that disaster-related tourism could actually lead to an increase in certain types of tourists, such as humanitarian tourists and persons visiting friends and family who have been victims of calamitous events (Rossello et al. (2020)).;HSCTCA_322;PriorWork
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Thus, more research on negative events in the tourism sector and the impact on different types of tourists would further shed light on this issue.;HSCTCA_323;Recommendation
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The relatively large difference in the degree of the initial impact between cruise ship and airplane arrivals during the month of a strike and 1 month after may be explained by the fact that when a hurricane hits the region, cruise ships simply re-route and change their itinerary to avoid affected areas.;HSCTCA_324;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;This is done by either skipping a scheduled stop, which results in staying an extra day at sea, or by substituting the skipped port/island with another one (CC, 2020).;HSCTCA_325;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;By doing so, cruise ship passengers miss one or more of their destinations, and leave the skipped port/islands with no chance to attract these missed tourists in the immediate future.;HSCTCA_326;Results

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;A possible explanation for this might be the relative flexibility of airlines compared to that of cruise ships when dealing with a hurricane.;HSCTCA_332;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;For instance, if a hurricane disrupts a planned flight, airlines generally allow (or are forced to by consumer laws) their passengers to reschedule their trip with no penalties, no fees, and no changes in fares within a relatively short space of time (Perkins, 2016).;HSCTCA_333;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The rescheduling usually leads to a travel postponement of only a couple of days (Perkins, (2016) and Glusac, (2019)) rather than complete cancellation of the trip.;HSCTCA_334;Background

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;A possible explanation for the discrepancies between cruise ship and airplane travelers might be the price incentives and discounts offered by airlines and hotels following a hurricane.;HSCTCA_337;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;For instance, after a hurricane occurs, airlines and hotels usually offer discounted prices to attract visitors to try to recover the drop in demand (Pace, 2018).;HSCTCA_338;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Meanwhile, cruise ship companies do not offer additional discounts ex post a hurricane because cruise ship prices are already at a discounted price during the hurricane season (CC, 2020).;HSCTCA_339;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Furthermore, cruise ship tourists do not book hotel nights at their stops because they already paid for their cruise ship rooms, thus the discounted hotel prices do not offer any further incentives for them.;HSCTCA_340;Results

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;However, it is important to point out that this finding heavily relied on rough tourist expenditure data, which are hard to obtain and may significantly vary from island to island.;HSCTCA_345;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Additionally, it must be noted that our revenue figures do not consider the costs incurred through the various promotions and discounts offered to visitors, as well as the added costs of post-disaster clean-up and repair. Preferably, one would want to know the profit per tourist.;HSCTCA_346;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;After all, these are net spend (revenue) numbers, meaning that profits might be significantly reduced due to costs associated with trying to attract more tourists through repairs and discounts.;HSCTCA_347;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;This article provides empirical results that hurricanes unfavorably impact visitor arrivals in Caribbean SIDS, which has significant managerial implications.;HSCTCA_348;Conclusion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The Caribbean is disaster prone as it is highly susceptible to frequent and intensifying hurricane risk exacerbated by climate change (CCRIF, 2010).;HSCTCA_349;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The Caribbean is also the most tourism-dependent region globally for income, employment, and foreign exchange (Mooney and Zegarra, 2020).;HSCTCA_350;Background
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;"The fall in arrivals after a hurricane strike is likely due to damages to infrastructure including air and sea ports, amenities, hotels and other accommodations, and tourist attractions, along with a general increase in economic and social disruption and safety and security concerns, all of which reduce the destination’s ability to accommodate tourists and its attractiveness, at least in the short term (Becken et al., 2015; Rossello et al., 2020; Sonmez et al., 1999).";HSCTCA_351;Discussion

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;As such, it is imperative that the Caribbean place special emphasis on tourism disaster management and planning and mitigation to buffer against destructive hurricane events and their accompanying reductions in tourist arrivals.;HSCTCA_353;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;According to the literature, tourism disaster management often involves a reactive approach to disaster response and recovery efforts rather than a proactive approach that involves strategic planning and prevention approaches to crisis and disaster management in the sector (Ritchie, 2008).;HSCTCA_354;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;There is also a lack of disaster management in tourism and appropriate frameworks to increase tourism disaster management at the destination level (Hystad and Keller, 2008).;HSCTCA_355;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Furthermore, there is limited research in understanding tourism reduction and readiness efforts and barriers in tourism disaster planning, to ensure more effective planning and management are undertaken when catastrophic events occur (Ritchie, 2008).;HSCTCA_356;Discussion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;In the Caribbean, a regional Disaster Risk Management Strategy and Plan of Action for tourism was developed between 2007 and 2010 through the collective action of regional as well as national stakeholders to address mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.;HSCTCA_357;Response
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The plan aims to enhance and supplement reactive measures with more proactive pre-event activities aimed at reducing the impact of potential hazards and plan for effective recovery (CDEMA, 2009).;HSCTCA_358;Response
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;It is also characterized by the recognition of the need to mainstream disaster risk management not only in tourism but also all sectors of society.;HSCTCA_359;Response
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;There is however no study on the effectiveness of preparedness, responses, and recovery methods in the Caribbean tourism industry.;HSCTCA_360;Recommendation
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Future research should therefore be placed on understanding the level of planning and preparedness for disaster events in the tourism sector and the development of effective reduction and readiness strategies linked to planning and prevention strategies.;HSCTCA_361;Recommendation

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;The damage from hurricanes in Caribbean SIDS leads to reductions in both air and cruise arrivals.;HSCTCA_364;Results
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Tourism managers in these destinations should focus on the recovery of essential infrastructure and business capability in order to restore tourism demand as soon as possible.;HSCTCA_365;Recommendation
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Proactive planning by tourism stakeholders around business continuity, business support networks, and recovery assistance programs, could accelerate this effort, where response and recovery is often led by individuals with a strong commitment to, and engagement with, the affected community (Rossello et al., 2020).;HSCTCA_366;Recommendation
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Marketing activities also have to be designed with care to attract the right types of visitors at the right time taking into account tourism capacity since natural disasters can attract certain types of visitors and encourage risky behavior.;HSCTCA_367;Recommendation
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Marketing campaigns implemented by businesses, local tourist organizers, and national tourism bureaus should align their messaging following a natural disaster to attract the right visitors at the right time.;HSCTCA_368;Recommendation

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;More specifically, we investigated the impact of hurricanes on tourism in the Caribbean, distinguishing between the effects on cruise versus air arrival tourists.;HSCTCA_371;Conclusion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;To this end, we compiled a monthly data set of tourist arrivals, hurricane damages, economic activity, and regional tourism demand, and employed a panel vector autoregression model where the hurricane effect was modeled as an exogenous shock to the system.;HSCTCA_372;Conclusion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Our results show that there was an immediate impact on both types of tourists, lasting a month, but the size of the reduction of tourists was substantially larger for air arrivals.;HSCTCA_373;Conclusion
HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Air arrivals recovered a few months later, implying that the net overall effect on tourism expenditure was roughly zero.;HSCTCA_374;Impact

HSCTCA;The impact of hurricane strikes on cruise ship and airplane tourist arrivals in the Caribbean;Our results have potentially important implications for disaster mitigation policies for the tourism industry in that they provide a first view on the quantitative impact, including monetary costs, of different segments of the tourism market.;HSCTCA_376;Recommendation
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Much of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada experiences a “Mediterranean-type climate”, indicative of an annual dry period characterized by hot, dry summers followed by an annual wet period characterized by cool, moist winters.;TMDCSN_1;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;While droughts have had an important influence on this region for millennia (Cook et al., 2007), the most recent drought (2012–2015) was characterized by large precipitation deficits and abnormally high temperatures during both the wet and dry seasons (Aghakouchak et al., 2014, Williams et al., 2015), and in some areas is thought to be the most severe in 1200 years (Griffin and Anchukaitis, 2014).;TMDCSN_2;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In particular, 2014 is noted for the lowest Palmer Drought Severity Index recorded for 1895–2017, when instrumental records were widely available (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/).;TMDCSN_3;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The 2012–2015 drought resulted in progressive canopy water stress of at least 888 million trees and severe canopy water stress of at least 58 million trees (Asner et al., 2016), substantial mortality of dominant and co-dominant trees (Brodrick and Asner, 2017), and impacts to many ecological goods and services.;TMDCSN_4;HazardDescription

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The level of tree mortality observed is considered by some to be unprecedented (Stephens et al., 2018), and over time will influence the frequency and severity of other disturbances.;TMDCSN_6;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;For example, Stephens et al. (2018) concluded that a greater potential for “mass fires” exists in future decades driven by the amount, size and continuity of dry combustible woody fuels, which could produce large, severe and uncontrollable wildfires.;TMDCSN_7;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In 2015, the USDA Forest Service Aerial Detection Survey (ADS), the group responsible for conducting annually surveys of insect and disease conditions, first reported extensive tree mortality in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, and estimated 29 million trees died in California due to drought and outbreaks of native bark beetles.;TMDCSN_8;Impact
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;"Winter 2015–2016 brought near normal precipitation to much of central and northern California, but drought stress remained high in many areas of the central and southern Sierra Nevada (U.S. Drought Monitor-California, 3 May 2016, extreme and exceptional categories; http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu).";TMDCSN_9;HazardDescription
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;ADS estimated an additional 62 million trees died in 2016 and 27 million trees in 2017, bringing the total to at least 129 million trees since 2010 (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 2018) (Fig. 1).;TMDCSN_10;Impact
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Much of the mortality occurred in and around the wildland urban interface, putting significant infrastructure and lives at risk (California Tree Mortality Task Force, 2018).;TMDCSN_11;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;While ∼200 species of bark beetles are native to California only a handful is capable of causing tree mortality (Fettig, 2016).;TMDCSN_12;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Trees of all species, ages and size classes may be colonized and killed, but each bark beetle species exhibits unique host preferences, life history traits, and impacts.;TMDCSN_13;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In most cases, the resultant tree mortality goes unnoticed until an outbreak occurs, which generally requires several years of favorable weather conducive to beetle survival and population growth, and an abundance of susceptible hosts (Bentz et al., 2010).;TMDCSN_14;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In particular, drought is an important factor inciting outbreaks of several notable species, including fir engraver, Scolytus ventralis LeConte, Jeffrey pine beetle, Dendroctonus jeffreyi Hopkins, mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins, western pine beetle, D. brevicomis LeConte, and several engraver beetles, Ips spp.;TMDCSN_15;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;A recent synthesis reported a non-linear relationship between drought intensity and outbreaks of aggressive bark beetles (i.e., those species capable of causing extensive levels of tree mortality) where moderate drought reduces bark beetle population performance and subsequent tree mortality, and severe drought increases bark beetle performance and tree mortality (Kolb et al., 2016).;TMDCSN_16;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The primary objective of our research was to determine causes and rates of tree mortality within three elevation bands on the Eldorado, Stanislaus, Sierra and Sequoia National Forests (Fig. 2), and to describe short-term impacts to forest structure and composition.;TMDCSN_17;Objective
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;These national forests are the four most southerly on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, and experienced the highest levels of tree mortality (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, 2018).;TMDCSN_18;Background

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;On each plot, trees ≥6.35 cm dbh (diameter at breast height, 1.37 m in height) were numbered, geo-referenced to plot center, and the species, dbh, condition (live or dead, based on the presence or absence of crown fade), cause of death (if applicable), and year of death (if applicable) were recorded.;TMDCSN_30;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;"For trees that died prior to plot establishment, year of death was estimated based on the color of faded needles in the crown and degree of needle retention (i.e., 1 year prior, >90% retention of yellow and/or red needles; 2 years prior, ≥50–90% retention of red needles; ≥3 years prior, <50% retention of red and/or gray needles) (Miller and Keen, 1960, Fettig et al., 2008).";TMDCSN_31;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Very few trees (<50, across the network) died ≥3 years prior to plot establishment, and were ignored.;TMDCSN_32;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;For trees that died after plot establishment, year of death was recorded as the year before crown fade was observed (e.g., in 2016 for trees colonized by bark beetles that year, but that first exhibited crown fade in early 2017).;TMDCSN_33;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Each plot was surveyed once annually, usually in April-June.;TMDCSN_34;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;For dead trees, a section of bark ∼625 cm2 was removed with a hatchet at ∼2 m in height on the north and south aspects to determine if bark beetle galleries were present.;TMDCSN_35;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The shape, distribution and orientation of galleries are commonly used to distinguish among bark beetle species (Furniss and Carolin, 1977).;TMDCSN_36;Method

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The precise role of each bark beetle species in contributing to tree mortality is generally unknown.;TMDCSN_38;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In some cases (e.g., D. brevicomis), trees must have enough green phloem for successful colonization and brood production to occur (Miller and Keen, 1960).;TMDCSN_39;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In other cases (e.g., Ips and Scolytus), successful brood production may also occur in dead and dying trees (Furniss and Carolin, 1977).;TMDCSN_40;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;We attributed tree mortality to colonization by D. brevicomis, D. ponderosae, California fivespined ips, Ips paraconfusus Lanier, pine engraver, I. pini (Say), S. ventralis, and cedar bark beetles, Phloeosinus spp., only when parental and brood galleries were observed in or beneath the sections of bark removed despite the presence of other potential diagnostic characteristics (e.g., pitch tubes higher on the tree bole).;TMDCSN_41;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;As such, our estimates of levels of tree mortality attributed to bark beetles are conservative. Dendroctonus brevicomis and D. ponderosae were observed infesting the same P. ponderosa on 22 occasions, and in these cases we attributed tree mortality to D. brevicomis (Fettig et al., 2008).;TMDCSN_42;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Tree mortality was attributed to Ips spp. only when evidence of D. brevicomis and D. ponderosae was absent and Ips spp. were present.;TMDCSN_43;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Suppression was assigned as the cause of death when evidence of other contributing factors (e.g., bark beetles, pathogens, and mechanical damage) was absent, and if little or no direct sunlight was received from above or on the sides of the crown (USDA Forest Service, 2018).;TMDCSN_44;Method
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In some cases, a contributing factor could not be identified, and cause of death was recorded as unknown.;TMDCSN_45;Method

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;These are not the same trees that would have been removed historically by low-moderate intensity wildfires, or targeted for removal in fuel reduction or forest restoration projects in more contemporary times (Stephens et al., 2012).;TMDCSN_101;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Large unburned areas of dead trees may produce succession patterns favoring shade-tolerant and hardwood tree regeneration, limited shrub growth, and accumulation of large woody surface fuels that will likely kill regenerating forests when wildfires occur.;TMDCSN_102;Background

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;No other significant differences were observed among elevation bands (mid-, 81.5 ± 2.6%).;TMDCSN_113;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;These differences likely result from drought stress being more severe at lower elevations and latitudes (Asner et al., 2016). Mortality was most severe in 2015–2016 (Fig. 3), concentrated in the larger-diameter classes (H = 118.7, df = 5, P < 0.001) (Fig. 4), and attributed primarily to D. brevicomis (Fig. 5).;TMDCSN_114;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;No mortality occurred in P. ponderosa ≤ 10.0 cm dbh.;TMDCSN_115;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This is not surprising as D. brevicomis exhibits a preference for colonizing large-diameter P. ponderosa (>50 cm dbh) (Miller and Keen, 1960).;TMDCSN_116;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Like most conifers, P. ponderosa is capable of mobilizing large amounts of oleoresin following wounding, which constitutes its primary defense against bark beetles (Franceschi et al., 2005).;TMDCSN_117;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Drought reduces carbon assimilation, water transport, and thus synthesis and mobilization of oleoresin (McDowell et al., 2011, Sala et al., 2012).;TMDCSN_118;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Elevated temperatures and forest densification (Section 3.4) enhance the effect (Young et al., 2017) due to increases in maintenance respiration and evaporative demand (Ryan, 1991).;TMDCSN_120;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;As such, droughts occurring during warm periods are generally more damaging to plants than those occurring during cool periods (Breshears et al., 2005, Adams et al., 2009).;TMDCSN_122;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In most of California, D. brevicomis completes two and a partial third generation annually, but considerable variation in flight activity occurs (Fettig et al., 2004, Fettig et al., 2005).;TMDCSN_123;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Warm temperatures may increase the length of flight activity and voltanism of bark beetles.;TMDCSN_124;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;For example, high summer temperatures have been documented to prevent facultative prepupal diapause in spruce beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby, allowing D. rufipennis to complete their life cycle in one year compared to two years when diapause is invoked (Hansen and Bentz, 2003).;TMDCSN_125;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This and other factors have resulted in increased levels of tree mortality attributed to D. rufipennis in recent years (Hart et al., 2017).;TMDCSN_126;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This and other factors have resulted in increased levels of tree mortality attributed to D. rufipennis in recent years (Hart et al., 2017).;TMDCSN_127;Impact
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;While it is possible voltanism is increasing in populations of D. brevicomis in the central and southern Sierra Nevada (B.M.B., pers. observ.), we attribute the large amounts of P. ponderosa mortality observed to declines in host resistance due to severe drought stress and forest densification (Section 3.3).;TMDCSN_128;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;On occasion, mortality of P. ponderosa was attributed to D. ponderosae (14 trees) and Ips spp. (36 trees), but in these cases mortality was concentrated in the smaller-diameter classes (Fig. 5).;TMDCSN_129;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Dendroctonus ponderosae, I. paraconfusus and I. pini are also important disturbance agents in the Sierra Nevada, but unlike D. brevicomis colonize other Pinus in addition to P. ponderosa (Fettig, 2016).;TMDCSN_130;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In California, D. ponderosae infestations in P. ponderosa are typically confined to smaller (<31.8 cm dbh) trees, and its role is often secondary to that of D. brevicomis, particularly in larger-diameter trees (Fettig and McKelvey, 2014).;TMDCSN_131;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This is consistent with our observations (Fig. 5).;TMDCSN_132;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;However, given the species notable reputation as a disturbance agent (Negrón and Fettig, 2014), the paucity of mortality attributed to D. ponderosae is somewhat surprising and likely attributed to being outcompeted by D. brevicomis for drought-stressed trees.;TMDCSN_133;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Ips spp. generally colonize slash, saplings, and weakened trees.;TMDCSN_134;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Colonization rates are negatively correlated with tree diameter in P. ponderosa (Kolb et al., 2006), and trees 5–20 cm dbh are most frequently colonized as observed in our study (Fig. 5).;TMDCSN_135;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The Transverse and Peninsular mountain ranges of southern California experienced a similar outbreak of D. brevicomis in the early 2000s that resulted in substantial mortality of large-diameter (>43.2 cm dbh) P. ponderosa and Coulter pine, P. coulteri D. Don (Fettig, 2018).;TMDCSN_136;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Precipitation was the lowest in recorded history the year prior to the outbreak (Minnich et al., 2016), and was associated with a regional drought event that extended throughout much of the southwestern U.S. Air pollutants and root diseases were important inciting and contributing factors (Grulke et al., 1998, Jones et al., 2004).;TMDCSN_137;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Concerns regarding hazard trees, fire risk, transportation and accessibility, and power line maintenance were paramount (Fettig, 2018), similar to areas most affected by this outbreak (www.fire.ca.gov/treetaskforce/).;TMDCSN_138;Background

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Mortality was concentrated in the mid-diameter classes (Fig. 6) (H = 20.7, df = 5, P < 0.001), and primarily attributed to D. ponderosae (Fig. 7).;TMDCSN_144;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Mortality of only one P. lambertiana was attributed to Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch, the invasive pathogen that causes white pine blister rust.;TMDCSN_145;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;While all size classes of P. lambertiana are susceptible to white pine blister rust, smaller trees most frequently suffer lethal stem cankers (Maloney et al., 2011).;TMDCSN_146;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;It is thought that drought results in less rust infection (Kolb et al., 2016) due to the moist conditions required for disease progression (Van Arsdel et al., 1956).;TMDCSN_147;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;White pine blister rust and fire exclusion appear to be having significant impacts on P. lambertiana populations in the Sierra Nevada (van Mantegm et al., 2004) only to be exacerbated by this tree mortality event.;TMDCSN_148;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This is concerning given the limited P. lambertiana regeneration observed (Table 3).;TMDCSN_149;Results

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Mortality tended to be concentrated in the mid-diameter classes, but no significant differences were observed among diameter classes (H = 7.6, df = 5, P = 0.18).;TMDCSN_155;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Mortality was primarily attributed to S. ventralis (Fig. 9).;TMDCSN_156;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Outbreaks of S. ventralis are often associated with trees stressed by drought, defoliation, root pathogens or other factors (Ferrell et al., 1994).;TMDCSN_157;Background

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Mortality of C. decurrens ranged from 13.7 ± 3.8% on the Eldorado to 26.6 ± 5.5% on the Stanislaus, but no significant differences were observed among national forests (H = 3.3, df = 3, P = 0.35).;TMDCSN_161;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Significantly higher levels of mortality occurred in the low (40.1 ± 5.9%) compared to the high elevation band (7.9 ± 2.2%) (H = 24.9, df = 2, P < 0.001).;TMDCSN_162;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;No other significant differences were observed among elevation bands (mid-, 22.1 ± 3.6%).;TMDCSN_163;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;No trends were observed among diameter classes (Fig. 10).;TMDCSN_164;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Most mortality was attributed to suppression, however in larger trees morality was often classified as unknown (Fig. 11).;TMDCSN_165;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In both cases, drought was likely a significant contributing factor.;TMDCSN_166;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The bark beetle genus Phloeosinus contains several species in North America that colonize the twigs, branches and stems of trees weakened by drought or other factors (Fettig, 2016).;TMDCSN_167;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Surprisingly, only five trees were colonized and killed by Phloeosinus spp. (Fig. 11), which likely underrepresents the true contribution of this species as sampling was limited to the tree bole.;TMDCSN_168;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;While Phloeosinus spp. are generally not considered an important cause of tree mortality, droughts in the Sierra Nevada during the 1980s and then again in the early 2000s resulted in significant branch flagging and some tree mortality attributed to western cedar bark beetle, Ph. punctatus LeConte (USDA Forest Service, 2003).;TMDCSN_169;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Stephenson et al., (2018) reported drought-induced dieback of giant sequoia, Sequoiadendron giganteum Lindl. (Buchholz), crowns in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in 2014.;TMDCSN_170;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Phloeosinus spp. colonized some trees, but mortality was limited and the role of Phloeosinus spp. in contributing to tree mortality was unclear (Stephenson et al., 2018).;TMDCSN_171;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;3.2.5. Quercus spp;TMDCSN_172;PaperSection
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Quercus are resistant to drought as they tend to be deep rooted, and form substantial mychorrhizal associations that enhance soil moisture uptake (Allen, 2015).;TMDCSN_173;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Quercus chrysolepis and Q. wislizeni are evergreen, and have sclerophyllous leaf structures that reduce evapotransporation (Plumb and Gomez, 1983).;TMDCSN_174;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Quercus kelloggii is deciduous, and may prematurely drop leaves to reduce evapotranspiration during periods of drought (McCreary, 2012).;TMDCSN_175;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Despite this, it is surprising that only one Quercus (Q. kelloggii) died given the amount of mortality observed in other tree species.;TMDCSN_176;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This is in contrast to a large oak decline event that occurred in the Ozark Mountains, U.S. during drought in the early 2000s.;TMDCSN_177;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;There, red oak borer, Enaphalodes rufulus (Haldeman), a native wood-boring beetle previously recorded only at endemic levels, contributed to substantial levels of tree mortality (Stephen et al., 2001).;TMDCSN_178;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The goldspotted oak borer, Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer, an invasive insect first associated with dying Quercus in San Diego County in 2008 (Coleman and Seybold, 2008), has caused mortality of large numbers of Quercus in southern California, but is not established in the Sierra Nevada.;TMDCSN_179;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;The species colonizes Q. kelloggii and Q. chrysolepis, among others, and represents a significant threat.;TMDCSN_180;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Infestations appear to be incited by drought, and it has been demonstrated that A. auroguttatus enhances drought stress in infested hosts (Coleman et al., 2011).;TMDCSN_181;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;3.3. Tree mortality and density;TMDCSN_182;PaperSection
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;We observed significant positive relationships between the number of trees and the number of trees killed (F1, 178 = 143.2, P > 0.001, R2 = 0.45, Fig. 12), basal area and the number of trees killed (F1, 178 = 18.5, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.10), and SDI and the number of trees killed (F1, 178 = 45.9, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.21).;TMDCSN_183;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Hayes et al., (2009) reported basal area and SDI were strong predictors of levels of tree mortality attributed to D. brevicomis in California (R2 > 0.90).;TMDCSN_184;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In their study, plots with the highest densities experienced the highest levels of tree mortality on both an absolute (number of trees killed) and proportional (% mortality) basis.;TMDCSN_185;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;We observed a significant negative relationship between the number of trees and proportion of trees killed (F1, 178 = 30.1, P > 0.001, R2 = 0.15), and a negative relationship between SDI and the proportion of trees killed (F1, 178 = 6.9, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.04), although neither explained much variation.;TMDCSN_186;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In our study, density-dependent mortality of trees may have been masked by severe drought stress as observed in other systems (e.g., Floyd et al., 2009).;TMDCSN_187;Discussion
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Simply put, relative competition (e.g., for soil moisture) becomes less important during severe drought when few resources are available to any trees. Hayes et al., (2009) attributed the relationship between stand density and tree mortality to impacts on individual tree vigor and water availability (e.g., Kolb et al., 1998, Sala et al., 2005, Wallin et al., 2008), and pheromone plume distributions (Thistle et al., 2004).;TMDCSN_188;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;They reported measures of tree competition were better predicators of tree mortality than measures of host availability recorded as basal area of P. ponderosa and numbers of P. ponderosa.;TMDCSN_189;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Similar, we found measures of host availability explained less variation than measures of stand density (data not shown).;TMDCSN_190;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Negrón et al., (2009) reported the probability of P. ponderosa mortality caused by bark beetles was positively correlated with tree density during drought in Arizona.;TMDCSN_191;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Fiddler et al., (1989) showed that thinning significantly reduced the amount of P. ponderosa mortality attributed to bark beetles in California.;TMDCSN_192;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;No tree mortality occurred in stands of <9 m2 per ha of basal area, which agrees with the optimal stocking level of 11 m2 per ha described by Oliver, 1979a, Oliver, 1995.;TMDCSN_193;Results

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;A SDI value of 230 defined a threshold for a zone of imminent bark beetle-caused tree mortality within which endemic populations killed a few trees, but net stand growth was positive.;TMDCSN_197;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Only 27 plots had SDI values ≤230 and only half (91 plots) had SDI values ≤365 in 2014.;TMDCSN_198;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Based on these thresholds, the majority of our plots would have been classified as “susceptible” to mortality by bark beetles, and those that were not existed as small islands in a larger landscape mostly classified as “susceptible”, which likely increased their susceptibility due to contagion (Miller and Keen, 1960).;TMDCSN_199;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In 2017, 84 plots had ≤11 m2/ha of basal area, and 175 plots had SDI values ≤365. Based on these data, most plots would now be classified as of “low susceptibility”.;TMDCSN_200;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;As such, we expect to observe little tree mortality attributed to bark beetles during the next several years, especially in reference to D. brevicomis given the paucity of suitable hosts that remain (Fig. 4).;TMDCSN_201;Results

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;For example, the density of A. concolor, C. decurrens and Quercus spp. was much greater in the understory than in the overstory, as has been reported elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada (Gray et al., 2005).;TMDCSN_211;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Calocedrus decurrens seedlings and saplings are generally considered more drought tolerant than the other conifers (Pharis, 1966), but respond more slowly to release and are often heavily browsed by deer, Odocoileus hemionus Raf. (Powers and Oliver, 1990).;TMDCSN_212;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Competition for light and soil moisture are primary factors limiting tree regeneration in the Sierra Nevada (Van Pelt and Franklin, 2000), especially in mixed-conifer stands.;TMDCSN_213;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;However, the higher light environment in the understory resulting from mortality of the overstory may kill some of the advanced regeneration that has mostly shade foliage (Boardman, 1977), but surviving individuals are likely to have more favorable growing conditions due to reduced competition for soil moisture.;TMDCSN_214;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In the near-term, substantial litter and duff accumulations from the abundance of dead trees will likely further favor establishment of tree species other than P. ponderosa, due to its seed bed requirements (Powers and Oliver, 1990).;TMDCSN_215;Results

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Competition by Chamaebatia foliolosa and Arctostaphylos spp. has been demonstrated to reduce P. ponderosa seedling survival and growth in multiple studies (Oliver, 1979b, Tappeiner and Radosevich, 1982, White and Newton, 1989).;TMDCSN_218;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;We observed little mortality of shrubs, which are capable of capturing and uptaking soil moisture at much lower concentrations than most trees, buffering shrubs from drought stress (Hurteau and North, 2008).;TMDCSN_219;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Cover by forbs and grasses was variable throughout the network (Table 4), but more forbs were observed on the Sierra than the Stanislaus (H = 13.1, df = 3, P = 0.004).

TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;4. Conclusions;TMDCSN_230;PaperSection
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Droughts accompanied by warmer temperatures (i.e., “hotter droughts” or “global change-type droughts”) are increasingly recognized as important drivers of tree mortality not only in the western U.S. (Fettig et al., 2013, Crockett and Westerling, 2018), but worldwide (Allen et al., 2010, Allen et al., 2015, Hartmann et al., 2018).;TMDCSN_231;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In short, warming amplifies chronic and acute water stress, and increases the incidence and severity of forest disturbances and drought-induced mortality of forest vegetation.;TMDCSN_232;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;During recent decades, tree mortality attributed to bark beetles has exceeded that by wildfires in the western U.S. (Hicke et al., 2016) raising concerns about the sustainability of some forests (Morris et al., 2018).;TMDCSN_233;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In our study, 48.9% of trees died in a period of three years, most of which were P. ponderosa in the larger-diameter classes.;TMDCSN_234;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Accordingly, we observed immediate shifts in forest structure and compositions, with a decline in the relative proportion of P. ponderosa and increases in the relative proportions of C. decurrens, Q. kelloggii and Q. chrysolepis.;TMDCSN_235;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Tree regeneration was dominated by C. decurrens and Quercus spp., however additional surveys are required to get a better understanding of recruitment of these species to the mid- and overstory.;TMDCSN_236;Recommendation
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In the absence of management intervention, we expect to see some type conversions (e.g., to Cedrus and Quercus or shrublands), particularly in the lower elevations of the southern Sierra Nevada where mortality of dominant and co-dominant trees was most severe.;TMDCSN_237;Results
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Recently, the California Tree Mortality Task Force (2017) released recommendations for comprehensive restoration of the Sierra Nevada.;TMDCSN_238;Response
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Key elements of their plan include: (1) increasing the pace and scale of thinning, prescribed burning and managed wildfire, (2) rebuilding California’s forest products industry to facilitate adequate biomass removals, (3) improving forest structure for wildlife habitat, (4) restoring ecologically-sensitive areas (e.g., meadows), (5) facilitating important legislative and administrative reforms that act as barriers to project implementation, and (6) monitoring and adaptive management.;TMDCSN_239;Response
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In areas where substantial tree mortality has not yet occurred (e.g., some mid- to high elevations of the Eldorado), forest managers might reduce stand densities to increase the resilience of forests to drought and disturbances incited by drought (North et al., 2015a, Kolb et al., 2016, Fettig et al., 2018a, Fettig, 2018) by use of mechanical thinning and/or fire, the latter either prescribed or managed wildfires (North et al., 2015b).;TMDCSN_240;Response
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;To that end, Goulden and Bales, (2014) showed that evapotranspiration increases exponentially with increased Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, a measure of forest greenness and density) supporting the value of thinning to reduce drought stress in the southern Sierra Nevada, and a recent study of the Illilouette Creek Basin in Yosemite National Park found increases in wetness occurred following 40 years of managed wildfire (Boisramé et al., 2017).;TMDCSN_241;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Numerous other studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of thinning to increase resistance and resilience to bark beetles (Fettig et al., 2007) and wildfire (McIver et al., 2013).;TMDCSN_242;PriorWork
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;There are other tools available (e.g., insecticides and semiochemicals) to protect individual trees (e.g., blister rust-resistant P. lambertiana) or stands of trees from mortality attributed bark beetles during periods of drought (Fettig and Hilszczański, 2015).;TMDCSN_243;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;To that end, it is likely that stocking thresholds (e.g., Oliver, 1995) will need to be lowered to maintain adequate levels of resistance and resilience under increased levels of drought stress projected for this region (Diffenbaugh et al., 2015).;TMDCSN_244;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;High variability thinning (focused on spatial complexity) coupled with prescribed burning may best align forests in the central and southern Sierra Nevada with historical conditions, which were known to be more resilient to drought and disturbances incited by drought (Knapp et al., 2017).;TMDCSN_245;Recommendation
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Tree mortality resulting from colonization of native bark beetles is an important part of the ecology of these forests.;TMDCSN_246;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Some level of tree mortality is desirable and often results in a mosaic of age classes and tree species compositions that increases resistance and resilience to multiple disturbances (Fettig, 2012).;TMDCSN_247;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;This differs from impacts associated with large-scale outbreaks, which may negatively impact several ecological goods and services, including timber and fiber production, water quality and quantity, fish and wildlife populations, recreation, grazing capacity, biodiversity, endangered species, carbon sequestration and storage, and cultural resources, among many others (Morris et al., 2018).;TMDCSN_248;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;It is important to note that the ecology and impact of bark beetles is also influenced by other biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic (e.g., management activities and land use patterns) disturbances that also directly influence successional pathways.;TMDCSN_249;Background
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;To our knowledge, this is the most severe outbreak of D. brevicomis in recorded history, and among the largest for any bark beetle in recent decades in the western U.S. (Fettig et al., 2018b, Fettig, 2018).;TMDCSN_250;Conclusion
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;Furthermore, much of the tree mortality occurred in and near the wildland urban interface (California Tree Mortality Task Force, 2018), which may foreshadow impacts of future outbreaks of D. brevicomis (and other species) as human populations shift from the eastern to western U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012).;TMDCSN_251;Conclusion
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;It also highlights increased mortality risks for trees during severe droughts, particularly under warmer temperatures attributed to climate change (Clark et al., 2016, Crockett and Westerling, 2018).;TMDCSN_252;Conclusion
TMDCSN;Tree mortality following drought in the central and southern Sierra Nevada, California, U.S.;In the future, it is likely that more frequent extreme weather events will increase the frequency and magnitude of severe ecological disturbances in many forests, driving rapid and often persistent changes in forest structure, composition and function across large landscapes.;TMDCSN_253;Conclusion
